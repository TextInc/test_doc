<head>The Value of Prudence</head>

<p>Have prudence: it is a great virtue. No doubt there <lb/>is a base prudence; - that which makes the mere senses the <lb/>ultimate tests of all value, ans which calls everything righteous <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> that happens to be gainful. But the true prudence is that <lb/>which, while it pays the just price of all its needs, will have full <lb/>value for every payment. And hence, in the long run, it must <lb/>gather into itself the best chances of success. In other words, it <lb/>must be greatly secure in a pecarious world - a world of profit and loss - <lb/><add>simply</add> because its balance is perfect. And finally, if it is selfish, it is also <lb/>social; redeeming its own slips by a self recovery that is invulnerable, <lb/>and the slips of others by that sureness of council and help which converts <lb/>them into its clients</p>

<lg><l>Power's cheat, success but trying,</l>

<l>And in the world-wide way we're going</l>
<l>Streams of pure good yet are flowing -</l>
<l rend="indent">Hark! I hear them murmuring.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Friendship turns, itself denying,</l>
<l rend="indent">Even truth the heart may wring;</l>
<l>Still, though trust be daily dying,</l>

<pb n="4" facs="A90/00000009.jpg"/>

<l>Listen still to Hope replying:</l>
<l>"The Flowers will come again with Spring!</l>
<l>And in the blasted way we're going</l>
<l>There's yet <hi rend="ul">one</hi> healing current flowing -</l>
<l rend="indent">Hark! I hear it murmuring."</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>All is dream-like, all off wingeth -</l>
<l rend="indent">All that time and tide can bring!</l>
<l>Then cold Death his black pall bringeth -</l>
<l><del>Rest</del> <add>Still</add> what matter while Hope singeth:</l>
<l>"Lo, Heaven is one eternal Spring!</l>
<l>And midway through it rolls a river</l>
<l>Wherein to bathe is <del>joy</del> <add>health</add> for ever -</l>

<note xml:id="A90-00000009"><p>This expression was once objected to by an intelligent <del>reader</del> <add>person</add> to <lb/>whom the poem was read, as being too obviously sought for the rhyme's <lb/>sake only. But the expression had been well considered, and is true on all sides. <lb/>State, - whether a squireen's or a monarch's, - is emphatically <hi rend="ul">invasion</hi> upon <lb/>our time, our means, our peace.

<p>[It will be rememebered that, <hi rend="ul">not a great many</hi> <add>about twenty years</add> years <lb/>back, a party of Stockmen (several of whom were afterwards <lb/>executed for the crime) made wholesale slaughter of a <lb/>small tribe of defenceless Blacks - to the number, it is <lb/>believed, of more than a score - heaping their bodies, <lb/>as they slaughtered them like cattle, upon a large fire <lb/>kindled for the purpose. Of this doomed tribe, one <lb/>woman only, with her infant, as it appeared subsequently <lb/>upon evidence, escaped the Whiteman's vengeance. <lb/>And this Poem is supposed to describe the ejaculations <lb/>of the Mother, after she has fled to a considerable <lb/>distance from the scene of the massacre, and when <lb/>wearied and overtaken by the night.]</p>

<head>Part VI</head>

<lg><l>Within a rustic chamber, dark and low,</l>
<l>And with wild-looking men &amp; women thronged,</l>
<l>I seemed to wake - but knew not <del><unclear></unclear></del> what I was.</l>
<l>Nor how I had been thither brought: nor why?</l>
<l>I was not large, my consciousness ere long</l>
<l>Had measured that fact. Inwardly I felt</l>
<l>No buskness of existence, but a sense</l>
<l>Of languor rather, or revival slow.</l>
<l>And ever more the men &amp; women same</l>
<l>And looked at me with wonder, and with shouts</l>
<l>Significant of conformed astonishment</l>
<l>Then would the whirl about the room in dance</l>
<l>Abandoned to their barbarous delights!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">As thus I <add>surely</add> strengthened into life</l>
<l>I looked about the chamber, half in hope</l>
<l>And half in fear, of seeing it might be</l>
<l>The mighty Angel who now ruled my life</l>
<l>My gestures were mistaken for a wish</l>
<l>To breathe the open air; <del>and forth at once</del> <add>and I was borne</add></l>
<l><del>They bore me</del></l>
<l>Towards a wide-casement. Like a picture large</l>
<l>The world without, and instantly confirmed</l>
<l>My hitherto vague impression that a new</l>
<l>Life-changw had passed upon me. On all hands</l>
<l>Nothing but mountains feathered to their tips</l>
<l>With a dense fell of pines, and valleys filled</l>
<l>With a cold darkness that was <del><unclear></unclear></del> alone</l>
<l>Dull vapour, like a canopy of smoke,</l>
<l>And so obscured the sun, that I had <del><unclear></unclear></del> thought</l>
<l>The scene that now I saw was not of Earth</l>
<l>But <del>that</del> <add>for</add> a golden flush that now and then</l>

<pb n="151" facs="A90/00000154.jpg"/>

<l>Would touch the highest ranges. <del>And at this</del> What I had</l>
<l>Indeed become I knew not, but I still</l>
<l>Retained impressions of my former roots</l>
<l>And often made vain efforts to expand</l>
<l>The <unclear></unclear> I had no longer, and sail off</l>
<l>And though those sullen vapours - up, and up</l>
<l>Into the mighty silence of the blue.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The day was fading, and a blare of horns</l>
<l>With <unclear></unclear> voice and much trampling noise</l>
<l>Heard from without around me. And ere long</l>
<l>The women that been before around me</l>
<l>Again rushed in - each bearing some such robe</l>
<l>Or <add>some</add> gay bauble, wherewithal they soon</l>
<l>Arrayed me to their task, and holding then</l>
<l>Armour up before, I perceived</l>
<l>My soul had this time passed into the form</l>
<l>A young female. The whole truth was this</l>
<l><del>The being whom I</del></l>
<l>The being whom I now reanimated</l>
<l>Was the sole child of a Circussian Chief</l>
<l>A maiden of most memoral beauty</l>
<l>Who had been long regarded by her house</l>
<l>As its chief treasured, and as such reserved</l>
<l><del>To</del> <add>For</add> him alone no matter whence, he came</l>
<l>Whose lust could dip into the longest purse</l>
<l>But Envy lurks in the Circussian hills</l>
<l><del n="1"><unclear></unclear></del> As <del n="2">she lurks</del> elsewhere, and a dose of opium,</l>
<l>Administered by one who had been long</l>
<l><del>The <unclear></unclear> beauty of a <unclear></unclear> tribe</del></l>
<l><del><unclear></unclear></del></l>
<l>The rival beauty of a <unclear></unclear> tribe</l>
<l>Had served to quash a <unclear></unclear> complete</l>
<l>Save in the final payment of the gold</l>
<l>Which had been even <unclear></unclear> and told down</l>
<l>And only <hi rend="ul">not</hi> excepted by some old</l>
<l>Delaying ceremony of the tribe;</l>
<l>And in which luckless circumstance, 'twas <unclear></unclear></l>
<l>That both my admirable parents saw</l>
<l>The unkindest cut of all.</l>
</lg>

<pb n="152" facs="A90/00000155.jpg"/>

<lg><l rend="indent">On all hands forth</l>
<l>Had scouts been sent, to summon all the tribe</l>
<l>To attend my obsequies, and then forthwith</l>
<l>To exterminate our ancient enemies!</l>
<l>But while these things were pending, lo, the light</l>
<l>Had broken like a morning from the eyes</l>
<l>Of the dead beauty; on her cheeks had dawned</l>
<l>A roseate color; from her moistening lips</l>
<l>Low murmers too had broken: whereupon</l>
<l><unclear>My</unclear> parents, in the exultant hope of still</l>
<l>Consummating their bargain, had transformed</l>
<l>The fancial to a general tribal feast</l>
<l>And loaded me with all the family <unclear>gauds</unclear></l>
<l>And ornaments they held. The Persian too</l>
<l>Had been inverted to renew his purchase</l>
<l>And carry me at once beyond the chance</l>
<l>Of future opium doses</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">With the rest</l>
<l>Back had he galloped, and was now without,</l>
<l>Eager once more to bear me to the arms</l>
<l>Of his long-<unclear></unclear> Lord. Within he came</l>
<l>In wonder, but full ready to make good</l>
<l>His former bargain and pay down the <del>gold</del> prier</l>
<l>My worthy parents tenderly embraced me,</l>

<pb n="153" facs="A90/00000156.jpg"/>

<l>With many tears, protesting that I was</l>
<l>The life light of their eyes - their rose of Joy!</l>
<l>Then stretched their palms out for the Persian gold,</l>
<l>And hurried off to tell it oer in secret:</l>
<l>The dear recovered treasure they so late</l>
<l>Had mourned, as lost for ever. On that night</l>
<l>I was packed carefully on a camel's back</l>
<l>Beside a case of porcelain pipes and gini-cracks</l>
<l>And carried Persia-ward, by stages long</l>
<l>From the Circussian mountains.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">At the court</l>
<l>I soon became the favorite of the king;</l>
<l>Lived sumptuously, but in perpetual fear.</l>
<l>My food was served to me on plates of gold</l>
<l>I slept on beds the furniture of which</l>
<l>Were fringed with countless pearls; and yet no less</l>
<l>I envied the poor slave who swept the floors</l>
<l>My Persian Lord for one whole month had been</l>
<l>Devoted to me - for a month and more:</l>
<l>And then I heard my place was to be filled</l>
<l>By a new favorite. And strange to say,</l>
<l>Albeit I loathed him as we loathe a snake,</l>
<l>I could not bear that he should thus supply</l>
<l>My presence with another. I would make</l>

<pb n="154" facs="A90/00000157.jpg"/>

<l>An effort to regain his faded favor:</l>
<l>For I was beautiful - and therefore vain</l>
<l>As beauty needs must be. And to that end</l>
<l>I now arrayed myself in robes that seemed</l>
<l>Aeriel ultimates of perfect whiteness,</l>
<l>While scarfs of purple such as only queen's</l>
<l>May purchase from the Indus Caravans,</l>
<l>Barred them with rainbow tints; a burnished band</l>
<l>Of purest gold, whose midst throughout was raised</l>
<l>With a full row of pearls - all perfect ovals -</l>
<l>Held in the wavelets of my sunny hair:</l>
<l>A gem that seemed indeed a frozen mass</l>
<l>Of white fire, flashed upon my silk-soft brow.</l>
<l><del>And</del> <add>Then</add> in my loveliness, even thus arrayed,</l>
<l>I swam into his presence (though indeed</l>
<l>My hid feet rowed me) graceful as a swan!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The Harem girls applauded, while thus seemed</l>
<l>Even in his own dull eyes almost a flash</l>
<l>As of exhorted joy: but which became</l>
<l>At the next moment a malignant scowl,</l>
<l>Which had its dark source in such thoughts as these:</l>
<l>(As <del>from a Nubean girl <unclear></unclear> after <unclear></unclear></del> <add>I learned after from a Nubean girl</add></l>
<l>Who always waited in his baser needs)</l>

<pb n="155" facs="A90/00000158.jpg"/>

<l>"What! did a soft and <unclear>egriorant</unclear> minx like me</l>
<l>Think to entrap again a man like <hi rend="ul">him</hi>,</l>
<l>Who was the sharpest fellow, past all doubt,</l>
<l>In all the orient? Did a minx so raw</l>
<l><del>Think</del> Ween to outwit a piece of such intelligence,</l>
<l>By floating in before him, like a swan,</l>
<l>A little better feathered than at first?"</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Even while this mischief had been mustering up,</l>
<l>The Harem ladies had been all been dismissed,</l>
<l>The Nubean girl alone remaining; then</l>
<l>A conclave of those singular gnome-like <del>things</del> dwarfs</l>
<l><ref target="A90-00000158">*</ref> <del n="1">Who housed no one knew where, were summoned in:</del> <del n="2">came</del> <del n="3">whence</del></l>
<l>Nor was the council long: I on that night</l>
<l>Was to be poisoned - and with a pomegranate,</l>
<l>One of a number to be pluckt and brought</l>
<l>For every lady of his Harem, forth</l>
<l>At supper, from his <add>favorite</add> Summer Garden <del>trees</del>,</l>
<l>And one too for himself, though he disliked them.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The Nubean had slipped away and told me</l>
<l>All she had learned: yet her news moved me not,</l>
<l>So sure I felt that such was not my doom;</l>
<l>Or moved me but to this - the packing up</l>
</lg>

<lg><l><add>Who from their secret dens and holes would come</add></l>
<l><add>At given signals forth, were summoned in</add></l>
</lg>

<pb n="156" facs="A90/00000159.jpg"/>

<lg><l>Of such gay properties as ladies doat on</l>
<l>But time slid on, and we were summoned forth</l>
<l>To supper. On the centre board <del>of a crate</del> there stood</l>
<l>Of silver <del><unclear></unclear></del> crate piled high with crimson goards</l>
<l>And these the king despersed amongst us soon,</l>
<l>To every lady one; till two at last</l>
<l>Alone remained, one of them being marked.</l>
<l>This came to me, nor could I but accept it,</l>
<l><add>But mindful of the part I had to play,</add></l>
<l><del>But on the instant</del></l>
<l>Even as I tool it I fell fainting down</l>
<l>And flurried all the ladies, till they thronged</l>
<l>About me - flurried even the king himself.</l>
<l>With infinite dexterity I then</l>
<l>Revived as suddenly, and contrived the while</l>
<l>Amid the bustle to exchange the goards -</l>
<l>Took his, and left him mine. His soon I ate</l>
<l>And praised as being the very soul of fruit.</l>
<l>He also with a rollic in his eye</l>
<l>Ate that which had been poisoned, and avowed</l>
<l>He never knew before what fruit it was,</l>
<l>Nay, that it held within its crimson rind</l>
<l>The juice of Paradise.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">While this went on</l>
<l>I had slipped away wholly unseen to where</l>
<l>My goods were packed, and to prepare for flight.</l>

<pb n="157" facs="A90/00000160.jpg"/>

<l>Nor had I long withdrawn, ere to my chamber</l>
<l>The Nubean girl came running; telling me</l>
<l>That soon the king had with a monstrous snort</l>
<l>Fall'n prostrate; while the ladies all away</l>
<l>Had scattered like a flock of gossamer clouds</l>
<l><add>Before a storm wind in a summer sky</add></l>
<l>And that the chamber now was thronged instead,</l>
<l>To suffocation, with <del>musty</del> fusty mass</l>
<l>Of <del><unclear></unclear></del> bare-poled hakims and grey-haired Physicians,</l>
<l>Who all concurred at least in this - the dark</l>
<l>Affair in hand was quite unlooked for - quite,</l>
<l>And had strong symptoms of a "poison-case"</l>
<l>And as she told her news the Nubean laughed</l>
<l>With infinite delight - so loved are kings!</l>
<l>And I laughed also, feeling that I had</l>
<l>A natural and a perfect night to do so.</l>
<l>But no time might be wasted - and we fled</l>
<l>Together, loaded both with costly spoils.</l>
<l>Still as we passed beneath the latticed Court</l>
<l>Wherein the Monarch suffered, all in vain</l>
<l>I strove to dash my womanly desire</l>
<l>To have a last look at him. So aloft</l>
<l>I mounted, on the slave's bent back - and looked.</l>
<l>The king was sprawling on the pillowy floor,</l>
<l>With quite a herd of anxious quacks about him;</l>

<pb n="158" facs="A90/00000161.jpg"/>

<l>Jews &amp; Armenians, infidels and slaves,</l>
<l>All ranks, all races; and as still he took</l>
<l>Their nostrums, with grimaces horrible,</l>
<l>He still kept threatening them, that if they failed</l>
<l>To cure him ere that dreadful night were past,</l>
<l>The dawn should see them headless - every man!</l>
<l>Then would he <del>curse the whim that made him choose</del> <add>wonder, why he ever chose</add></l>
<l>Pomegranates for his supper. Then in rage</l>
<l>He cursed his blunder, and the palpable trick</l>
<l>By which a silly woman had o'er reached him!</l>
<l>Then would he sprawl, and bellow like a beast!</l>
<l>And so I left him sprawling, while the sound</l>
<l>Of his brute ragings followed us beyond</l>
<l>The Garden bounds as through the dark we fled!</l>
<l>- We heard long after, that he died ere he</l>
<l>Had time to cut off <hi rend="ul">all</hi> the doctor's heads.</l>

<l>Though they saw thus, - and not the less perhaps,</l>
<l>If of the women sort, because 'twas plain</l>
<l>My conduct most was from its balance thrown</l>
<l>By wherein, and by human almost mad <del>,</del> -</l>
<l>These always, and the closlier they knew me,</l>

<l>Loved me - nay, served as the Nubian did.</l>
<l>And now as no one else might sell me - lo,</l>
<l>I sold myself, and thought that I had made</l>
<l>A capital bargain, till I found myself</l>
<l>Throned as the wife of a rude Afric Chief,</l>
<l>Black as a log of ebony, and who</l>
<l>As still at stated times, in motley state,</l>
<l>On bow-bent shanks and <del>huge</del> <add>big</add> pot-bellied bulk,</l>

<l>In the wild dark round Joy's imagined tomb;</l>
<l>Or save when doubts that over Love may lour</l>
<l>Like summer clouds, break in a sunny shower</l>

<l>The bowers of memory with their grateful fall.</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">Never</hi> laugh either in Song's measured tone</l>
<l>If all the wit is in the laugh alone,</l>
<l>Or all the humor in a "ha-ha-ha"</l>
<l>That should clink (very sheepishly) with "baa".</l>
<l>Never write madly, as if nimble wits,</l>
<l>Like Arabs, showed best in their wandering fits.</l>

<head>Notes. <add>9.</add></head>

<p>(1.) The pathetic in poetry (as in all fiction) is never so truly <lb/>effective as when it is perfectly unforced, both in subject and <lb/>manner. To be supremely exquisite, it must be given to flow <lb/>naturally out of the subject in hand, <add>and</add> not be cast about it like <lb/>a mourning cloak. Hence, whenever a poet takes up his pen <lb/>of set purpose to search our hearts to the very core, it is more than <lb/>likely, that he will only search our patience to an unpleasant degree, <lb/>or <del>irk and</del> disgust us with some <add>vile and</add> bloated mockery of sorrow. Any <lb/>undertaker can bespangle the lid of a coffin with tinsel-headed <lb/>nails: to bedrop it with tears is another matter, of which <lb/>nature, and not artifice, must be the principal getter up.</p>

<p>In so much does the truest pathos result from an unforced <lb/>treatment of a doleful matter, that we are always most nearly <lb/>touched by such pathetic descriptions as appear to come in <lb/>quite incidentally. There is a fine example of this in Henry <lb/>Taylor's Philip Van Artevelde. I know of no passage in any <lb/>author, more sweetly sorrowful; more holy in the moral depth <lb/>and beauty of its sadness. It is an account of the appearance <lb/>in death, of two children, who have perished of famine during <lb/>the seige of Ghent, and is spoken by Clara the sister of <lb/>the hero.</p>

<div type="poem">

<lg><l>He plucked aside the curtain of the couch,</l>
<l>And there two children's bodies lay composed.</l>

<pb n="172" facs="A90/00000175.jpg"/>

<l>10.</l>
<l>They seemed like twins of some ten years of age,</l>
<l>And they had died so nearly both together,</l>
<l>He could not say which first: <hi rend="ul">and being dead,</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="ul">He put them, for some fanciful affection,</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="ul">Each with its arm about the other's neck;</hi></l>
<l>So that a fairer sight I had not seen</l>
<l>Than those two children, <hi rend="ul">with their little faces</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="ul">So thin and wan, so calm, and sad, and sweet.</hi></l>
<l>I looked upon them long, and for awhile</l>
<l>I wished myself their sister, and <hi rend="ul">to lie</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="ul">With them in death as they did with each other.</hi></l>
<l>I thought that there was nothing in the world</l>
<l>I could have loved so much; and then I wept.</l>
</lg>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>Again: - A pathetic effect in poetry is never more entire <lb/>than when, by the seeming absuptness of unmixed passion, <lb/>it is light, as it were, somewhat short of itself - but <lb/>suggestively so; or than when, in its means, it is brought <lb/>bluffly out, and as suddenly terminated, like a natural <lb/>crag, - upon whose rigid verge we are left hanging, in the <lb/>agony of our sympathy, as over some dim unmeasured <lb/>profound of loss unspeakable. No doubt this fulness of <lb/>effect is often thus achieved through the suggestion of Art; but <lb/>then it is true art, itself the suggestion of Nature. There is a <pb n="173" facs="A90/00000176.jpg"/> <add>11.</add> <lb/>short poem by Wordsworth, which will <del>amply</del> <add>strikingly</add> illustrate my meaning.</p>
