<p>This copy (intended to be a<lb/> final one) of of any Poems.<lb/> was made in my own house at<lb/> Euroma, in <hi rend="ul">1863</hi>.</p>
<p>Chas: Harpur.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear adding<lb/> to the above memo, that it is my<lb/> somewhat unpleasant impassion,<lb/> the future (capable) reader of the<lb/> Manuscript, will be anything but<lb/> grateful<lb/><pb n="2" facs="A89/00000004.jpg"/> gratified by the fact, that the<lb/> Poems which make up the contents<lb/> of it, should, for a period of over twenty<lb/> years, have gone a begging as it were -- and<lb/> in vain -- about the land of their in-<lb/>spiration, for publication in the form of<lb/> a presentable Book -- or indeed for<lb/> publication in any form that did not, or<lb/> would not, entail a certain pecuniary<lb/> loss upon their not over-prosperous<lb/> Author.<add>C.H.</add></p>

<head>The Bard of Paradise.</head>
<div>
<head>I.</head>
<lg><l>Blind Seer with the soul's all-piercing eyes!</l>
<l>Son of Urania! Bard of Paradise!</l>
<l>Milton! the triumph of whose epic fame</l>
<l>Shall roll in ever-gathering pomp, and rise</l>
<l>With distance louder on the world's acclaim!</l>
<l>When those usurping names now fondly dinn'd</l>
<l>Abroad by Fashion's folly babbling brood,</l>
<l>Shall have been swept by Truth's prevailing wind,</l>
<l>Like weeds, to where upon Time's wasteful shore</l>
<l>Oblivion watcheth for his mortal food --</l>
<l>Shall have been syllabled by Repute no more</l>
<l>For ages. Yea; and then <hi rend="ul">his</hi> golden lore</l>
<l>By kindred spirtis <del>meetlier</del><add>wiselier</add> understood,</l>
<l><add>And meetlier <unclear/> than before,</add></l>
<l>The humbled Epic Muse to glory shall restore.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>II.</head>
<lg><l>Monarch of Song supreme! defeat and blame</l>
<l>In the comparison shall surely dwell,</l>
<l>For him who with a rival's boast shall claim</l>
<pb n="4" facs="A89/00000006.jpg"/>
<l>To search the blissful fields of Heaven as well,</l>
<l>And by the ghastly light of penal flame</l>
<l>Venture so far into the wastes of Hell.<ref target="A89-00000006">*</ref></l>
<l>For look upon his genius in its free</l>
<l>And fearless voyage through Infinity,</l>
<l>Must the prim rhymers of more modern time,</l>
<l>As emulous sparrows perched on brambles eye</l>
<l>The noble eagle on his path sublime,</l>
<l>Through the dim vistas of a clouded sky,</l>
<l>--Lone sailing, -- like that ship wherein did fare</l>
<l>--Glorious Columbus, when first seen to trace</l>
<l>--The bays of a new world, -- lone sailing where</l>
<l>--Log cape-like vapors bank the <add>[gleaming spekcless]</add> depths of Space.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>III.</head>
<lg><l>'Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down</l>
<l>The dark descent,' he saw the World of Dole,</l>
<l>With all its rueful gulfs in heaps upthrown,</l>
<l>Where the dread surges in their broken roll</l></lg>

<lg><l>Wedged up like crags of fire, in prospect shown</l>
<l>Through blasting storms that deafened o'er the howl</l>
<l>Of universal bale, and thence did wage</l>
<l>Blind siege along Hell's stedfast cope, or bowl</l>
<l>In horrible conlfict round, with undiminishable rage!</l>
<l>See tower-like Demons crowding through the gloom,</l>
<l>Clashing, indignant of their terrible doom,</l>
<l>Their gleamy shields! that as they serry far</l>
<l>Out into the dark, its lurid depths Mume</l>
<l>With mixing curves and intermittant rings,</l>
<l>As lurking lightnings all the black clouds scar</l>
<l>With sudden shapes of dragon-semblant things,</l>
<l>When first the thunders of a tempest boom!</l>
<l>Or where that earliest birth of Ruin's womb</l>
<l>The Pandemonium of their grisly kings,</l>
<l>Upblazing, a malignant splendor flings,</l>
<l>They mass in legions duskily descried</l>
<l>Through that weird light's inconstant flickerings!</l>
<l>Others aloft in furious whirlwinds ride</l>
<l>Practising battle; or in banded hordes</l>
<l>Under the conduct of their several lords,</l>
<l>On bold discovery wander far and wide,</l>
<l>And with a pale astonishment admire</l>
<l>Those dens of desolation where abide</l>
<pb n="6" facs="A89/00000008.jpg"/>
<l>Chimera monstrous births, or list those dire</l>
<l>And ghastly uproars ever heard beside</l>
<l>The infernal rivers, whose drear tides reach wild</l>
<l>Out through the Alps of Death, dim in the distance piled.</l></lg>

<head>IV.</head>
<lg><l>Next us from forth the Ark afar and fast</l>
<l>The dove o'er the unbounded deluge swept,</l>
<l>Seeking for Land, -- so, o'er the limitless Vast</l>
<l>That erst enwombed Creation, outward leapt</l>
<l>His daring Muse; borne on the lightning wings</l>
<l>Of prophecy, and which as on they past</l>
<l>And threw broad splendors o'er all covert things,</l>
<l>Revealed its Anarch legioned wide around</l>
<l>With haggard Phantoms, such as madness <del>flings</del><add>brings</add></l>
<l>Athward some mind that with distempered strength</l>
<l>Outgrows the actual world. That Gulf profound</l>
<l>Thus did she voyage, -- to return at length</l>
<l>With tidings of the secrets drear and dread</l>
<l>That in its loud and horrible riots dwell --</l>
<l>Of shoreless seas; of igneous skies that shed</l>
<l>A hail of fire with many a writhing swell</l>
<l>And inward knashing as aloft they hung;</l>
<l>Of bedless bogs; of deserts drifting dead;</l>
<pb n="7" facs="A89/00000009.jpg"/>
<l>Of homeless mountains that still onward fled</l>
<l>Like clouds, or, meeting in huge justle, rung</l>
<l>With grinding thunders till perchance they sped</l>
<l>Within some Void, -- when, caught as by a spell,</l>
<l>Together there a sullen space they swung</l>
<l>In silence -- hushed at once; then lumbering fell</l>
<l>Downward for ever! These she saw outflung</l>
<l>In one confusion 'twixt the bounds of Hell,</l>
<l>And where, back shrinking as in grim surprise,</l>
<l>THe skirts of Chaos reflect Creation's coasting skies.<ref target="A89-00000009">*</ref></l></lg>

<div>
<head>V.</head>
<lg><l>Through brightening spaces now Urania soars,</l>
<l>Leaving the regions of phantasmal glooms:</l>
<l>Hark! from above a wondrous music pours,</l></lg>
<note xml:id="A89-00000009"><p>Here, carried away by his imagination, the Author has<lb/> established a Chaos differing rather widely from Milton's<lb/> -- and differing no doubt for the worse, as being less philoso-<lb/>phical. Of this, however, he was quite aware when writing<lb/> the passage, though somewhat young at the time, and too<lb/> ardent to be very critical. But he had thrown the ruins upon<lb/> the neck of his Pegasus for the occasion, so as to let him fly <del>wilfully</del><add>wide,</add><lb/><del>wild</del><add>and somewhat wildly</add>, though not altogether at random.</p></note>

<lg><l>And <del>thrilling o'er, in widening circuit</del><add>circling over, wave on wave, out</add>, roams</l>
<l>Far into Chaos; for the living doors</l>
<l>Of Heaven, before her, are self-opening, hued</l>
<l>With lamping glories of celestial gold,</l>
<l>And turned on hinges inwardly endued</l>
<l>With a melodious spirit. They unfold,</l>
<l>And out on the wild front of Darkness old</l>
<l>Flames a vast <del>splendor</del><add>radiance</add>! while beyond in view</l>
<l>The measureless expanses are unrolled</l>
<l>Of an immortalising World of light</l>
<l>And sempeternal beauty! peopled through</l>
<l>With Powers and with Virtues burning bright</l>
<l>In the reflected strength of God, and who</l>
<l>Legioned together in supernal state</l>
<l>And blissful willinghood, day without night</l>

<lg><l>And now from Heaven descended, to the Bower</l>
<l>In Paradise we are led, -- where Raphael lends</l>
<l>At Adam's board his presence till the hour</l>
<l>Of evening warn him thence. Like that of friends</l>
<l>Their converse: now we list the Angel tell</l>
<l>Of that wild warfare which in Heaven befell,</l>
<l>When his proud standard Satan there unfurled,</l>
<l>Defying God! and listening, apprehend</l>
<l>A rushing turmoil such as might attend</l>
<l>The starry frame of all this nether world</l>
<l>In ruin -- system against system hurled!</l>
<l>Then tells he how at God's command arose,</l>
<l>Burning in beauty through the darkness, out</l>
<l>Of Chaos and Old Night, whatever glows</l>
<l>In all this vast of worlds; and how the shout</l>
<l>Of Angel myriads in wonder burst</l>
<l>And filled all nature with triumphant throes,</l>
<l>When they beheld the new born glories first!</l>
<l>And when the heavenly Historian's voice</l>
<l>Suspends awhile, -- look we around, and lo</l>
<l>All animals, immortal all, rejoice</l>
<l>In pristine innocence: the wolf and the roe,</l>
<l>The lion and the lamb, the hound and hare,</l> 
<pb n="10" facs="A89/00000012.jpg"/>
<l>The horse with proud mane peacefully a-flow,</l>
<l>The sleek cat purring in the marmot's lair,</l>
<l>The pard, ox, elephant, -- one happy crowd!</l>
<l>With serpents, beautiful as threads of cloud</l>
<l>When they hang burning o'er the horizon's hoop,</l>
<l>At sunset, -- all in concord feed or play</l>
<l>Under some broad-spread tree whose branches droop</l>
<l>Loaded with globes of edible gold alway.</l>
<l>And flowers and blossoms of divinest hues,</l>
<l>And breathing all as sweetly as if they</l>
<l>Were blissfully conscious, in star-clusters spring</l>
<l>Beneath or bloom above; and warblers whose</l>
<l>Bright plumes are painted by Perfection, sing</l>
<l>Amid them, or, like winged Ioys, effuse</l>
<l>Their songs in flight, and, overflying, fling</l>
<l>Swift spendlors, that like rainbows span the clear</l>
<l>Lit spaces 'twixt the <del>intershadowings</del><add>billowy <del>shadows</del> leafiness</add> shed</l>
<l><del>Of</del><add>Of<del>From</del></add> neighbouring groves; while insect myriads near,</l>

<l>And glowing in such glory as to appear</l>
<l>Incarnate ardors, -- all in concert ring</l>
<l>Murmurous peals of dizzy-mixing sound</l>
<l>Such as intone the shining hours of Spring,</l>
<l>Blithely monotonous; and lapsing round</l>
<pb n="11" facs="A89/00000013.jpg"/>

<div>
<head>VII.</head>
<lg><l>Now turn we to the Bower again, to hear</l>
<l>Adam his happy history relate; --</l>
<l>Into the affable Archangel's ear</l>
<l><del>Pouring</del><add>He pours</add> the blest experience of a state</l>
<l>Only inferior to his own, and dear</l>
<l>Even as a brother's welfare to a brother:</l>
<l>While busied near them, his so precious mate</l>
<l>And dainty ultimate of all delight,</l>
<l>The Garden's gentle Empress -- Eve our mother,</l>
<l>Clothed only with her grace, in such sweet plight</l>
<l>Is moving, and with manners so profuse</l>
<l>Of lovely influence and magic might,</l>
<l>As doth by royal right divine induce</l>
<l>Palpable homage from whatever wings</l>
<l>The air, and walks the ground, -- and even beguile</l>
<l>Tokens of heed from now-insensate things!</l>
<l>Yea, quickened with a fresher spirit while</l>
<pb n="10" facs="A89/00000012.jpg"/>
<l>She looketh on them, are the flowers and trees!</l>
<l>Yea, her all-felt perfection gives the voice</l>

<div>
<head>VIII.</head>
<lg><l>Thus in the spirit of prophetic Song</l>
<l>With fearless foot Hell's dread profound along</l>
<l>Trod Milton -- where the lost for ever weep;</l>
<l>And thence upon Uranian pinions strong</l>
<l>Shot sheer -- out into Chaos, whose hoar deep</l>
<l>Its dismal secrets struggling still to keep --</l>
<l>Even as <del>dark</del><add>torn</add> clouds and surging vapours, <del>grey</del><add>all</add>,</l>
<l><del>All wildly writhing</del><add>Crushed up together</add>, round a whirlwind heap --</l>
<l>Upturned its embryon worlds against him in dismay.</l>
<l>Emerging thence with a rejoicing leap</l>
<l>And soaring -- up, even to Heaven's golden gates,</l>
<l>He through them saw in the eternal clear</l>
<l>Of central peace, all his great Muse relates!</l>
<l>But to return within Creation's sphere</l>
<l>Tow'rds one fair Star, that grew, like Vesper, white,</l>
<l>Then like the Moon -- then vaster, and when near</l>
<l>Because the Earth in her first green delight!</l>

<head>The Drowned, Alive.</head>
<lg><l>I was once so deeply drowned,</l>
<l>That when the drag my body found,</l>
<l>'Twas void of motion, void of breath,</l>
<l>And, to sensation, dead as Death.</l></lg>

<lg><l>In a languid summer mood,</l>
<l>Lo, I plunge into a flood,</l>
<l>That to the low sun's slanting beams</l>
<l>Gleameth only quiet gleams,</l>
<l>Each one, with a flicker, sheeting</l>
<l>From its still floor -- fast and fleeting.</l>
<l>Such a flood as one would say</l>
<l>Could never, or by night or day,</l>
<l>Have drenched a man's warm life away.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But what are these, down in its bed,</l>
<l>That trail so long and look so red,</l>
<l>Moving as in conscious sport --</l>
<l>Are they weeds of curious sort?</l>
<l><add>But</add></l>
<pb n="15" facs="A89/00000017.jpg"/>
<l>But I will dive to them, and see</l>
<l>Into all their mystery.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Down I dive. -- A plenteous crop!</l>
<l>Some shall with me to the top;</l>
<l>For here there is too dim a light</l>
<l>To show their character aright.</l>
<l>I wind them in my arms, intent</l>
<l>To root them up in my ascent.</l>
<l>But they resist me, and again</l>
<l>I tug them with a stronger strain.</l>
<l>Full well, I trow, they hold their own,</l>
<l>Gripping fast each bedded stone</l>
<l>With their rooty tubes, that go</l>
<l>Thence down, through the stiff slime below.</l>
<l>Well, the worst of't is, that I</l>
<l>Must leave them -- But in vain I try!</l>
<l>Fierce as lightning on my brain</l>
<l>Smites the dread truth -- I try in vain!</l>
<l>Yea, more and more, in coils and flakes,</l>
<l>Like long blood-red water snakes,</l>
<l>The deadly things around me clasp,</l>
<l>The more I tug, the more they grasp!</l>
<l>My pent breath, growing hot and thin,</l>
<pb n="16" facs="A89/00000018.jpg"/>
<l>Explodes with a dull-booming din,</l>
<l>While through my unclenched teeth the wave</l>
<l>Comes drenching! Is there none to save?</l>
<l>None near to see -- to guess -- to trace</l>
<l>Under the flood's calm gleaming face,</l>
<l>The dread extremity of one</l>
<l>Thus fastened down? Ah! is there none?</l>
<l>Wild as vain my struggles grow --</l>
<l>Horror! horror! is it so?</l></lg>

<lg><l>Hope gives up her ghost -- Despair!</l>
<l>And as a fish dies in the air,</l>
<l>In <hi rend="ul">its</hi> element deep drowned,</l>

<l>The long weeds, erst so deeply red,</l>
<l>Look, even where nearest, grey as lead,</l>
<l>As 'mid them, settling down, I sway,</l>
<l>And life keeps bubbling fast away</l>
<l>Through my cold lips, wide agape,</l>
<l>And stiffening into that white shape</l>
<l>They take at last (when done with breath)</l>
<l>In the rigid face of Death.</l></lg>

<head>A Storm in the Mountains.</head>
<lg><l>A lonely Boy, far venturing from his home,</l>
<l>With a rude-visaged Herdsman do I roam:</l>
<l>A lonely, wilful Truant, aged eleven,</l>
<l>'Mid rock-browed mountains heaping up to heaven!</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">Here</hi> huge-piled ledges, ribbing outward, stare</l>
<l>Down into haggard chasms; onward <hi rend="ul">there</hi>,</l>
<l>The vast-backed ridges are all rent in jags,</l>
<l>Or hunched with cones, or pinnacled with crags!</l>
<l>A rude peculiar world, the Prospect lies</l>
<l>Bounded in circuit by the bending skies.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Now at some stone-rimm'd tank (scooped by the shocks</l>
<l>Of rain-floods leaping from the upper rocks),</l>
<l>Whose liquid disk glows in undimpled rest</l>
<l>Like a vast sapphire on the mountain's breast,</l>
<l>I drink, and muse, -- or mark the wide-spread herd,</l>
<l>Or list the tinkling of the dingle bird;</l>

<l>The fierce refracted heat flares visible --</l>
<l>Lambently radiant, like the lustrous hem</l>
<l>Of an else-viewless viel held trembling over them.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A change is felt -- a change that yet reveals</l>
<l>A somewhat only that mere instinct feels.</l>
<l>Why congregate the swallows in the air,</l>
<l>And northward then in rapid flight repair?</l>
<l>Unsettled all at once, and roaming slow</l>
<l>With hands declined, why do the oxen low?</l>
<l>With sudden swelling din, remote yet harsh,</l>
<l>Why roar the bull-frogs in the tea-tree marsh?</l>
<l>Why cease the locusts (<ref target="A89-00000024">*</ref>) to throng up in flight</l>
<l>And clap their gay wings in the fervent light?</l>
<l>Why climb they, bodingly demure, instead,</l>
<l>The tallest spear-grass to the bending head?</l>
<l>Instinctively along the sultry sky</l>
<l>I turn a listless yet enquiring eye,</l>
<l>And mark that now, with a most gradual pace</l>
<l>A solemn France keeps creaming o'er its face:</l></lg>

<l>Come to a heavy halt; -- as travellers see</l>
<l>In the wide wilderness of Araby,</l>
<l>A pilgrim horde let even, band by band,</l>
<l>Halting amid the grey interminable sand.</l>
<l>And soon descending with a slumberous weight,</l>
<l>Its sullen influence settles on the great</l>
<l>Heads of the mountains, and the airs that played</l>
<l>About their rugged temples -- all are laid:</l>
<l>While drawing nearer far-off heights appear,</l>
<l>As in a dream's weird prospect -- strangely near!</l>
<l>Till into wood resolves their robe of blue,</l>
<l>And the grey crags come bluffly into view.</l>
<l>-- Such are the signs and tokens that presage</l>
<l>A Summer Hurricane's forthcoming rage.</l></lg>

<lg><l>At length the South sends out her cloudy heaps,</l>
<l>And up the glens a dusky dimness creeps.</l>
<l>The birds, late warbling in the hanging green</l>
<l>Of steep-set brakes, seek now some safer screen --</l>
<l>Skimming in silence o'er the ominous Scene.</l>
<l>The herd in doubt no longer wanders wide,</l>
<l>But, fast in-gathering, throngs yon mountain-side,</l>
<pb n="24" facs="A89/00000026.jpg"/>
<l>Whose echoes, surging to its trampling, seem</l>
<l>Like the gruff mattered troubles of a Titan's dream.</l></lg>

<l>Throng denser, or protruding-columns form;</l>
<l>While splashing forward from their cloudy lair,</l>
<l>Convolving flams, like scouting dragons, glare:</l>
<l>Low thunders follow, laboring up the sky;</l>
<l>And as forerunning blasts go blaring by,</l>
<l>At once the Forest bows! -- a mighty stir! --</l>
<l>Bows as in homage to the Thunderer.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Hark! from the wild dogs' blood-polluted dens</l>
<l>In the gloom-hidden chasms of the glens,</l>
<l>Long fitful howls wail up; and in the blast</l>
<l>Strange hissing whispers seem to huddle past,</l>
<l>As the dread stir had wakened from their sleep</l>
<l>Invisible Hags, cave-cloistered in each steep,</l>
<l>who wrapt them in the gloom, and rose amain,</l>
<l>To wanton in the wild-willed Hurricane!</l></lg>

<lg><l>The glow of day is quenched -- expunged the sun</l>
<l>By cloud on cloud dark rolling into one</l>

<l>Tremendous mass of latent thunder, there</l>

<l>Its surface, heaves into enormous heaps,</l>
<l>And seems a pendent ocean to the view,</l>
<l>With weltering whale-like forms all hugely roughened through.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Yet see in the Storm's front, devoid of dread,</l>
<l>How sails you Eagle, like a black flag spread</l>
<l>Before it, -- coming. On his wide wings weighed,</l>
<l>Hardly he seems to move from hence surveyed:</l>
<l>When, far aloft, a bulging mass of gloom</l>
<l>That bends out o'er him, bloating as with doom,</l>

<l>His dark form shrivels in the blasting light!</l>
<l>And, as then follows a sharp thunderous sound,</l>
<l>Falls whizzing, stone-like, lifeless to the ground!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Now like a shudder at great Nature's heart</l>
<l>The turmoil grows; and Wonder, with a start,</l>
<l>Detects where Thor right overhead careers,</l>
<l>Girt with black Horrors and wide-flaming Fears!</l>

<l>And then -- at once -- in utter silence end!</l>
<l>Portentious silence! Time keeps breathing past,</l>
<l>Yet it continues! May this marvel last?</l>
<l>Tingles the boding ear; and up the glens</l>
<l>Instinctive dread comes howling from the wild dogs' dens.</l></lg>

<l>A moment; -- then, from end to end, it shakes</l>
<l>With a quick motion -- and in thunder breaks!</l>
<l>Peal rolled on peal! while heralding the sound,</l>
<l>As each concussion thrills the solid ground,</l>
<l>Fierce glares coil snake-like round the rocky wens</l>
<l>Of the <hi rend="ul">lit</hi> hills, or hiss into the glens;</l>
<l>Or thick through heaven like flaming falchions swarm,</l>
<l>Cleaving the cloudy cisterns of the Storm,</l>

<l>Split by the blast, come sheeting, with a dash</l>

<l>Rustled away through the rounding brakes,</l>
<l>Or lingered, as it were to pine</l>
<l>In the twilight top of the turpentine</l>
<l>Its own low dirge -- a dying tone</l>

<l>And once a dusky eagle came</l>

<l>Yea, thus, for countless centuries, beneath</l>

<l>As individualised in all mankind,</l>
<l>Beyond the swoop of chance, and lifted high</l>
<l>Out of the crash of matter! She, complete</l>

<l>An ultimate of all that went before --</l>
<l>A Spirit of Thought, and thence a child of that</l>

<lg><l>I thank thee, Master; -- sit thou hear</l>
<l>Upon this bank. -- I am very old,</l>
<l>And dead and gone is many a year,</l>
<l>(The lost count must remain untold)</l>
<l>Since in my own far Country, near</l>
<l>My little orphan children twain,</l>
<l>I sat before our Hut of cane,</l>
<l>Which clung as twere to the ancient wood</l>
<l>Where once my Tribe's chief village stood: --</l>
<l>Methinks I see myself again</l>
<l>There sitting with my children twain,</l>
<l>Full in the pleasant evening breeze!</l>
<l>That Hut my dwelling long had been;</l>
<l>'Twas joisted in four living trees</l>
<l>That met aloft, high o'er the roof</l>
<l>In domes of solid shade sun-proof,</l>
<l>And from its wicker door the sheen</l>
<l>Of one clear brook might just be seen,</l>
<l>Or, if you listened, just be heard</l>
<l>Its mellow bubble, where 'twas stirred</l>
<pb n="50" facs="A89/00000060.jpg"/>
<l>From underneath by pebbles strown</l>
<l>About the bed, and thence upthrown</l>
<l>The margin reeds between;</l>
<l>Or when it made a murmurous moan</l>
<l>Over a ledge of mossy stone,</l>
<l>And which, so lonely 'twas and low,</l>
<l>Did ever, to the heart's relief,</l>
<l>Touch Memory with some gentle grief,</l>
<l>As always in its hidden flow</l>
<l>'Twere babbling of the long ago:</l>
<l>While from betwixt two trellised lines</l>
<l>Of large leafed intertwisting vines,</l>
<l>On which bright cooling berries grew</l>
<l>Like clustered drops of golden dew,</l>
<l>Far over slopes of forest green --</l>
<l>Far as might range the wondering eye,</l>
<l>The vast uprising Main was seen</l>
<l>To meet the bending sky.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Twelve moons before my Wife had died,</l>

<l>My heart, that else had dwelt in gloom</l>
<l>As buried in <hi rend="ul">their</hi> Mother's tomb.</l>
<l>And as I thought of this, with tears, --</l>
<l>The showers of a concealed distress,</l>
<l>Fast trickling from my palm-hid cheek --</l>
<l>(Oh, there's a grief itself endears</l>
<l>By its own very loneliness,</l>
<l>And love is aye both strong and weak!)</l>
<l>Behold, upon a wayside stone</l>
<l>Within the unbroken shadow thrown</l>
<l>Far outward by our household trees,</l>
<l>A seaward coming Whiteman moiled</l>
<l>With travel, and with dust besoiled,</l>
<l>Did seat him in the evening breeze;</l>
<l>And shaking out his sweat-damp hair,</l>
<l>He seemed to hunger, sitting there.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>6.</head>
<lg><l>And so I led (as closed the day)</l>
<l>My wondering Children forth, that they</l>
<l>Might with me for the Stranger feel,</l>
<l>And bid him to our evening meal.</l>
<l>"We have enough for all," I said,</l>
<l>"And some to spare, wherewith to stay</l>
<pb n="58" facs="A89/00000062.jpg"/>
<l>Thy need through all to-morrow's way.</l>
<l>Delay not, -- come, and still with bread</l>
<l>The heart's pine when 'tis hunger's prey.</l>
<l>With kindly hospitable pride</l>
<l>My Girl shall wash they fretted feet;</l>
<l>In soothing measures at thy side</l>
<l>My Boy shall sing a ditty sweet:</l>
<l>How once a wanderer had died</l>
<l>Of famine in the desert wide,</l>
<l>But that his Mother found him there</l>
<l>And saved him by her gentle care.</l>
<l>Learn hence my daughter ne'er to let</l>
<l>The stranger pass in his despair,</l>
<l>It help it thy best welcome can --</l>
<l>Thy brother may be wandering yet</l>
<l>A solitary man.</l>
<l>And know that I, in days of yore,</l>
<l>When wandering weary and alone</l>
<l>Thus sat before thy Mother's door</l>
<l>While from the brook she heaved her can --</l>
<l>Even thus upon a wayside stone,</l>
<l>A solitary man."</l></lg>

<lg><l>The Whiteman at my bidding rose</l>
<l>And followed; while my children went</l>
<l>Before, the wicket to unclose,</l>
<l>On hospitality intent.</l>
<l>Arriving there, the girl and boy</l>
<l>Shouted for charitable joy;</l>

<head>Part III.</head>

<head>1.</head>
<lg><l>Now plenteous was the meal I spread</l>
<l>Before him, with a pleasant air,</l>
<l>And heartily the Stranger fed,</l>
<l>And heartily he praised our fare.</l>
<l>And when he was sufficed, I threw</l>
<l>Our softest mat upon the floor,</l>
<l>That he might stretch him there and rue</l>
<l>The long day's weary weight no more.</l>
<l>And flattered much were we to see</l>
<l>The comfort and complacency</l>
<pb n="60" facs="A89/00000064.jpg"/>
<l>Which seemed his jaded sense to shroud</l>
<l>As in a shadowing summer cloud,</l>
<l>While breathing yet more deep and deep,</l>
<l>He <del>sank</del><add>sunk</add> into the depths of sleep:</l>
<l>When softly in my bended ear</l>
<l>My daughter slid these words of fear.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>2.</head>
<lg><l>"The Whiteman sleeps: his face how fair!</l>
<l>Yet some dread shade seems o'er it hung --</l>
<l>The token or of wrong or care,</l>
<l>Or secret hate. He looks but young,</l>
<l>And yet his strange unfizzled hair</l>
<l>In long flakes from his forehead flung,</l>
<l>Is flecked throughout with lines of grey</l>
<l>Like darkness at the dawn of day;</l>
<l>And see, at times, -- yea, even now,</l>
<l>How fiercely lours his knotted brow,</l>

<l>Dark memories of a stormy <del>yore!</del><add>Past</add></l></lg>

<head>3.</head>
<lg><l>Thus she: and then my boy, as nigh</l>
<l>The couch he watched, this lullaby</l>
<pb n="61" facs="A89/00000065.jpg"/>
<l>Sang softly: -- "Rest thee, Stranger, -- rest!</l>
<l>Thy need is past and friends are near;</l>
<l>No longer by the heat opprest,</l>

<lg><l>But when we too, on mats spread out,</l>
<l>In Sleep's descended cloud reclined,</l>
<l>Strange fattering fears, -- a troublous rout,</l>
<l>Kept peopling my prophetic mind.</l>
<l>I dreamt of Her that I had lost,</l>
<l>Who stealthily, methought, drew nigh</l>

<lg><l>Still, as I slumbered, many Forms</l>

<l>To kindred gathered to the worms,</l>
<l>Even when I started from my dream,</l>

<l>And closer too, than wont, my boy</l>

<l>His little dreams were not of joy,</l>

<div>
<head>Part IV.</head>
<lg><l>At length I slept -- too soundly! Cries</l>
<l>Were wildly shrilling in min ears,</l>

<l>Of weariness and care!</l>

<l>Alas! to see my children bound!</l>
<l>To see six tiger visaged men</l>
<l>All fiercely pressing round!</l>
<pb n="64" facs="A89/00000068.jpg"/>
<l>While <hi rend="ul">he</hi> -- our Guest, was standing near</l>
<l>The unmasked leader of the crew!</l>
<l>Yea, <hi rend="ul">he</hi>, in payment for our cheer,</l>
<l>The wrong they did us, bade them do!</l>
<l>In vain I knelt in suppliant fear,</l>
<l>And bathed his <del>feet</del><add>knees</add> with many a tear;</l>
<l>He dashed me <del><unclear/></del><add>down upon the floor!</add></l>
<l>And thriving with a demon sneer,</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>To see my front all</add> red with gore,</l>
<l>He bade his villains drag is where</l>
<l>Within a mangrove shrouded bay,</l>
<l>Like a sea monster in its lair</l>
<l>His lurking vessel lay, --</l>
<l>Distant three lonely leagues or more,</l>
<l>And whence, like wolves, the day before</l>
<l>He and his gang had prowled for prey.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>2.</head>
<lg><l>The rest is brief: they sold us here --</l>
<l>They tore the father from the child!</l>
<l>And cursed them for their shrieks so drear,</l>
<l>And scourged them for their grief so wild!</l>
<l>Nor have I, all the weary years</l>
<l>That I have drenched in Slavery's tears,</l>
<pb n="65" facs="A89/00000069.jpg"/>
<l>Learned whither went my boy, nor where</l>

<lg><l>But <hi rend="ul">he</hi> -- our base Enslaver! (this</l>

<l>Within them like the snakes of Hell!)</l>
<l>Next visiting the Afric coast,</l>
<l>One morning, ghastly as a ghost,</l>
<l>After a dread debauch, wherein</l>
<l>Wild Riot led the dance of Sin,</l>
<l>Rose raging, murder-mad, and slew</l>
<l>With sudden onslaught half his crew!</l>
<l>And through the rest with chains of strength</l>
<l>Did both him to the deck at length,</l>
<l>Amid the slaughtered in their gore;</l>
<l>Vain were all fetters! With a roar</l>
<l>Wild as a wounded pard's, he wrenched</l>
<l>His gyves, as they had been no more</l>
<l>Than yarns of flax; -- the hoop unclenched</l>
<l>From round his trunk -- the bolts uptore --</l>
<pb n="66" facs="A89/00000070.jpg"/>
<l>Leaped from the deck, and tow'rds the shore,</l>
<l>Though by the thundering surge deep drenched,</l>
<l>Swam shouting! -- made the beach and fled</l>
<l>Into the tangled jungles spread</l>
<l>Immensely inland, -- where, 'tis said,</l>
<l>Even the mighty lion blenched</l>
<l>Before the howling fratricide,</l>

<l>And he (for so the story ran)</l>
<l>Was born amongst a pirate crew,</l>
<l>And cradled in their bark;</l>
<l>And ever, up from boy to man,</l>
<l>More wildly fierce his nature grew,</l>
<l>His deeds more direly dark!</l>
<l>Boldly he compassed what he planned,</l>
<l>And boldly could the the bad command;</l>
<pb n="67" facs="A89/00000071.jpg"/>
<l>For nothing in the world thought he</l>
<l>Or worth his heed or rivalry,</l>

<lg><l>My Tale is told: nor more for me</l>

<head>The Bush Fire.<add>X</add></head>
<lg><l>'Tis nine o' clock -- to bed! cried Egremont,</l>
<l>Who, with his youthful household, long ago,</l>
<l>(The sturdy father of seven sturdy boys)</l>
<l>Dwelt in a lone Home nested far within</l>
<l>Our virgin Forest, that scarce broken then,</l>
<l>As with an unshorn fleece of gloomy wood</l>
<l>Robed the vast bulk of all the mighty Isle.</l>
<l>But ere retiring finally, he went</l>
<l>Forth as his wont was to survey the night.</l></lg>

<lg><l>'Twas clear and silent: and the stirless woods</l>
<l>Looked dreaming in the witch-light of the Moon,</l>
<l>As, like a boat of stained pearl, she <del><unclear/></del><add>rode</add></l>
<l>Dipping, it seemed, with a propendent motion,</l>
<l>Amid the ridges of a wavy cloud --</l>
<l>The only cloud in heaven: round which afar,</l>
<l>The larger stars out of the depths of space</l>
<l>Hung pendulous, trembling with a glow globose --</l>
<l>So keenly clear the night. And while our Friend</l>
<l>Looked thus <del>abroad</del> observingly abroad, he marked</l>
<pb n="70" facs="A89/00000074.jpg"/>
<l>All round him, listing the horizon's verge,</l>
<l>A broad unusual upward glaring gleam --</l>
<l>Such a drear raidance as the setting sun</l>
<l>Effuses when the atmosphere is stormy.</l></lg>

<lg><l>What this might be he wondered -- but not long;</l>
<l>Divining soon the cause -- a vast Bush Fire!</l>
<l>But deeming it too distant yet for harm,</l>
<l>During the night betiding, to repose</l>
<l>With his bed-faring household he retired.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Sound was their sleep: for honesty of life</l>
<l>Is somewhat lumpish when 'tis once a-bed.</l>
<l>And now the darkness of the night was past,</l>
<l>When with the dreams of Egremont, a strange</l>
<l>And momently approaching roar began</l>
<l>To mingle, and insinuate through them more</l>
<l>And more of its actual import -- till a Fire</l>
<l>Huge in imagination as the world,</l>
<l>Was their sole theme: then, as arising wild,</l>
<l>His spirit fled before its visioned fear,</l>
<l>He started from his sleep -- and found indeed</l>
<l>The hardly (it seemed) exaggerated type's</l>
<l>Conflagrant hugeness, from abroad derived</l>
<pb n="71" facs="A89/00000075.jpg"/>
<l>In warning! for what else, however terrible,</l>
<l>Save ocean snoring to a midnight storm,</l>
<l>Might breathe with a vitality <del><unclear/></del> at once</l>
<l>As that <add>So universal, strenuous, and fierce</add> which <del>reigned without</del> so roaringly without<add><del>(whate'er it was)</del> reigning, lapped and roared without!</add></l></lg>

<lg><l>Upleaping from his couch, Scare did he wait</l>
<l>To clothe himself, ere forth he rushed, -- and lo,</l>
<l>Within the circling forest he beheld</l>
<l>A vast and billowy belt of writhing fire,</l>
<l>That shed a wild and lurid splendor up</l>
<l>Against the whitening dawn, come raging on!</l>
<l>Raging and roaring as with ten thousand tongues</l>
<l>That prophesied destruction! On it came,</l>
<l>A dreadful apparition! -- such as Fear</l>
<l>Concieves when dreaming of the front of hell!</l></lg>

<lg><l>No time was there to lose. Up -- up! he cried</l>
<l>To all the house! Instantly all within</l>
<l>Was hate and wonder, and in briefest space</l>
<l>The whole-roused family was staring out</l>
<l>In speechless admiration! Yea, in that</l>
<l>Wild sympathetic union with the Terrible,</l>
<l>Which in the sudden and unlooked-for midst</l>
<l>Of a tremendous danger, oft ensues,</l>
<pb n="72" facs="A89/00000076.jpg"/>
<l>And, for a time, <del>keeps</del> through its <add>own</add> mere extreme</l>
<l>Keeps terror dormant. But more urgently</l>
<l>The voice of Egremont again was heard; --</l>
<l>Lose not a moment! Follow me at once,</l>
<l>Each with whatever he can grasp of use,</l>
<l>And carry unincumbered, as he flies!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Out from the doorway, Right before <add>them</add>, lo,</l>
<l>A narrow-strip of clearing, like a glade,</l>
<l>Stretched <del>out</del><add>on</add> tow'rds a bald summit. Thitherward</l>
<l>The perilled people now were hurrying <del><unclear/></del> all;</l>
<l>While in their front, beneath the ridge, a dense</l>
<l>Extent of dead brush into which the Fire's</l>
<l>Bright teeth were ravening, -- near, and nearer, brought</l>
<l>The rapid danger! Shall they reach that hill</l>
<l>Unscathed, their only refuge? Will they speed</l>
<l>Past the red-rushing exigence! And lo,</l>
<l>As thus they hurry on, how more and more</l>
<l>Disclosing spectre-like from the red gloom,</l>
<l>And brushing through them with long whizzing bounds,</l>
<l>The Kangaroos string forth in Indian file</l>
<l>Across that strip of clear; with here and there</l>
<l>A wild dog slinking rapidly along</l>
<l>Amid the general rout, human and brute!</l>
<pb n="73" facs="A89/00000077.jpg"/>
<l>Thus passingly involved, yet onward rush</l>
<l>Our people -- urged into a desperate pace</l>
<l>By the hot glare that now comes sweltering round,</l>
<l>And the loud roar that loudens all along</l>
<l>The line of their wild flight, as if the flames</l>
<l>Were wrathful at their prospect of escape</l>
<l>And hurried also -- hurried with a swoop,</l>
<l>And raged more ruinously while they weened</l>
<l>To intercept, and blast them! -- But at length</l>
<l>The grass-bald border of the summit's gained,</l>
<l>Even as the Fire, upon the left hand, breaks</l>
<l>Against the hill's base like a ruddy surge;</l>
<l>And hatting, they look back -- in safety all,</l>
<l>Though <add>scorched and</add> breathless, and <del><unclear/></del> begrimed with <del>heat &amp;</del> smoke</l></lg>

<lg><l>But <add>lo!</add> no sooner had they <add>crowding</add> passed</l>
<l>Out from the brush, where into a broad dell</l>
<l>It dipped on all hands round a sullen <del><unclear/></del> pool,</l>
<l>And where the rank and withered runners lay</l>
<l>In tangled heaps, -- than a vast swath of flame</l>
<l>Lifted and gurried forward by the wind</l>
<l>Over their very passage track, was pitched</l>
<l>Sheer into it, with a loud thud like thunder --</l>
<l>With such a thud as the sea-swell gives up</l>
<pb n="74" facs="A89/00000078.jpg"/>
<l>From under the ledges of some hanging cliff;</l>
<l>And, in an instant, all the wide sere depth</l>
<l>Was as a lake of Hell! And hark! as then</l>
<l>Even like a ghastly pyramid the mass</l>
<l>Of wide-spread flames, inlapping as they rose</l>
<l>And welding as it were all into one</l>
<l>Dense pile, rushed lancing up, -- up with them still</l>
<l>A long mad shriek of mortal agony went</l>
<l>Writhing aloft! -- so terrible indeed,</l>
<l>That those who heard it, never, until then,</l>
<l>Might deem a voice so earnest in its fear,</l>
<l>So strenuous in its anguish, could have being</l>
<l>In the live bosom of the <del>normal</del><add>suffering</add> world!</l>
<l>But soon did they divine, even to their loss,</l>
<l>Its import: -- there a giant steed, their best,</l>
<l>Had <add>vainly</add> taken cover, <del>there to die</del><add><del>but</del> to perish</add><add>so</add> there!</l></lg>

<lg><l><add><del>Sheltered <unclear/></del> Tented with heaven only -- but</add>All grouped</l>
<l>In safety now upon that hill's bare top --</l>
<l>Egremont and his household looked abroad</l>
<l>Astonished at the terrors of the time!</l>
<l>Down sunk their rooftree in the surging Fire;</l>
<l>Which entering next a high-grassed bottom, thick</l>
<pb n="75" facs="A89/00000079.jpg"/>
<l>With <del>bark</del><add>axe</add>-ringed trees <ref target="A89-00000079">*</ref> all standing bleak and leafless,</l>
<l>Tenfold more terrible in its ravage grew,</l>
<l>Upclimbing to their tops! And soon, as when</l>
<l>Upon some day of national festival,</l>
<l>From the tall spars of the ship-crowded poet,</l>

<lg><l>Out in the Forest looming through the smoke</l>
<l>Where dim and most like, farthest forth it rolls,</l>
<l>Behold how furiously a horseman comes!</l>
<l>Sent from the nearest station, though thus late,</l>
<l>To warm our people of the mighty Fire</l>
<l>Ere haply it reached them; -- telling them in time</l>
<l>How there, so lately, its red <del><unclear/></del> waves had brought</l>
<l>Sudden destruction, and wide loss, -- and then</l>
<l>Surged on illimitably through the woods,</l>
<l>Bearing right hitherward! Bravely on he steers</l>
<l>To where the fronting flames from either hand</l>
<l>Are closing to a gap! No other way,</l>
<l>All round, is open; and he nears it -- But</l>
<l>Too late, alas! or so to those it seems</l>

<l>And man and horse are swallowed out of sight</l>

<l>Lay like black gouts amid the general view</l>
<l>Of glimmering heights, which through the red light showed</l>
<l>Like some imaginary waste of Hell</l>
<l>Painted in blood! But nearer, all the scene</l>
<l>Was frightfully brilliant. From vast hollow trunks</l>

<l>The wild fire, with a sudden roar, would burst</l>

<l>All in one fiery train, back streaming, -- till</l>
<l>It shattered as it struck the blackened vale</l>
<l>Into a cloud of upward rushing sparks,</l>

It turned out to be a<lb/> species of hawk, of a greyish <del><unclear/></del> color generally, but speckled<lb/> on the breast and neck with brown; and from that night<lb/> forward the aforesaid screeches ceased to be heard anywhere there-<lb/> about -- at least during the whole time, a period of several months,<lb/> which I afterwards remained in the neighbourhood.

<div>
<head>14.</head>
<lg><l>And he is paler than a Lad</l>
<l>So free of limb should be,</l>
<l>And in his eye there lurks some sad</l>
<l>And singular mystery:</l>
<l>And that you Lamb <hi rend="ul">he</hi> worketh wrong</l>
<l>Whose <hi rend="ul">look</hi>, even, <del><unclear/></del> scares it from the throng,</l>
<l>Is pianfully plain to see.</l></lg>

<div>
<head>15.</head>
<lg><l>Alas! his mortal hate hath curst</l>
<l>A Creature that he loved at first --</l>
<l>Loved in a gentle sort:</l>
<l>Day by day this passion grew</l>
<l>To see it in its sport,</l>
<l><add>And</add></l>
<pb n="94" facs="A89/00000098.jpg"/>
<l>And many a fond thing would he do</l>
<l>Its mute regard to court.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>16.</head>
<lg><l>And ever his keen love to feed,</l>
<l>When forward the old Man should speed</l>
<l>To head the Flock -- alone</l>
<l>Leaving him there behind, to keep</l>
<l>The lambs all strown about in sleep --</l>
<l>In snowy patches strown,</l>
<l>On this particular <hi rend="ul">one</hi> he'd creep,</l>
<l>And sometimes sieze it at a leap,</l>
<l>And sometimes chase it down.</l></lg>
</div>

<div> 
<head>17.</head>
<lg><l>And when the little trembler so</l>
<l>Was taken, he would place</l>
<l>Its foremost feet his chin below</l>
<l>And gaze into its face:</l>
<l>But only <hi rend="ul">fear</hi> was living there --</l>
<l>Not what he yearned to trace.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>18</head>
<lg><l>Oh! had it been a thing with speech</l>
<pb n="95" facs="A89/00000099.jpg"/>
<l>Tow'rds which his love did glow,</l>
<l>Some sympathy within their reach</l>
<l>Sweet words had given to flow;</l>
<l>And through the might of his strange delight</l>
<l>To have wakened a kindred mood,</l>
<l>Had kept its fountain pure and bright,</l>
<l>And welling forth for good.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>19.</head>
<lg><l>But in the turned and timid face</l>
<l>He loved so well, to find</l>
<l>Of love and jpy no answering trace,</l>
<l>While <hi rend="ul">fear</hi> had there a constant place,</l>
<l>So shocked at length his mind</l>
<l>And shamed his heart, -- that in his grief</l>
<l>He turned to <hi rend="ul">hatred </hi> for relief!</l>
<l>Of so extreme a kind</l>
<l>Is the bitter smart of a young loneheart</l>
<l>Whose love is cast behind.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>20.</head>
<lg><l>"Wild wretch!" he cried: "Why this dismay --</l>

<l><add>Can</add></l>

</div>

<div>
<head>21.</head>
<lg><l>And daily then this hatred grew,</l>
<l>Till it erelong became</l>
<l>A load his very soul did rue:</l>
<l>And the mystery of the same,</l>
<l>After it still, like a scorpian, drew</l>
<l>A burning sting of shame.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>22.</head>
<lg><l>A hateful shame! And then he'd take</l>
<l>The lambkin as before,</l>
<l>But not, as <del>then</del><add>once</add>, the love to slake</l>
<l>That glowed in his life's red core;</l>
<l>But aye to beat and evil entreat</l>
<l>The Creature more and more.</l></lg>

<div>
<head>Part II.</head>
<div>
<head>1.</head>
<lg><l>At last a murderous intent</l>
<l>Did fasten upon his will,</l>
<l>And keep him pondering as he went</l>
<l>How he might safely Kill</l>
<l>The hated little Innocent,</l>
<l>And yet its blood not spill!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>2.</head>
<lg><l>For by the Lodge-fire, he of Cain</l>
<l>Had erewhile heard with dread,</l>
<l>And how the <hi rend="ul">blood</hi> of Abel slain</l>
<l>Although in secret shed,</l>
<l>Did <hi rend="ul">cry</hi> to God from the conscious sod,</l>
<l>Where it lay in a pool so red!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>3.</head>
<lg><l>And thus he feared to shed its blood,</l>
<l>Though fully bent to slay:</l>
<l>And wrung by this same murderous mood</l>
<l>Was he upon that day,</l>
<pb n="98" facs="A89/00000102.jpg"/>
<l>Whereon we saw the Flock outrun</l>
<l>At the red reprise of the sun,</l>
<l>And all the lambs in play.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>4.</head>
<lg><l>And outward still as the Flock did hie</l>
<l>Upon that morning bright,</l>
<l>A rushy plat, as he followed by,</l>
<l>Did take the Urchin's evil eye --</l>
<l>"Here, crouching out of sight,</l>
<l>As the sheep <unclear/> home in the evening gloom,</l>
<l>I'll wreak (thought he) my spite!</l>
<l>Tied by the neck in the rushes here,</l>
<l>And left deserted, surely Fear</l>
<l>Will <hi rend="ul">kill</hi> it in the night!"</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>5.</head>
<lg><l>The Mom hath died in its mountain pride,</l>
<l>And yet the Flock feeds out --</l>
<l>Till his sun-robe, flaming at noon world-wide,</l>
<l>Old Time, for haste, hath half cast aside,</l>
<l>Trending west with a shadowy stride --</l>
<l>And then 'tis fetched about,</l>
<l><add>And</add></l>
<pb n="99" facs="A89/00000103.jpg"/>
<l>And taught to keep with a well-spread sweep</l>
<l>Upon the homeward route.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>6.</head>
<lg><l>And now the golden Eventide</l>
<l>Is glowing in the west --</l>
<l>Glowing like a Summer bride</l>
<l>Upon old Winter's breast!</l>
<l>Oh! how can Hate in all the wide</l>
<l>And lovely world, thus beautified,</l>
<l>Dare harbour unconfest --</l>
<l>Nor casting off its hellish scroff</l>
<l>Transform to a Spirit blest?</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>7.</head>
<lg><l>So feels even that rude-nurtured child</l>
<l>If his heart aright I read --</l>
<l>And yet as though the woody wild</l>
<l>The fleecy breeders feed</l>
<l>Wide-whitening homeward -- should they pass</l>
<l>Near yonder nook, even <hi rend="ul">there</hi>, alas!</l>
<l>Will he do a hateful deed!</l></lg>

<div>
<head>8.</head>
<lg><l>And the ground is moist, and the spear grass high,</l>
<l>And the herbage greenest there,</l>
<l>And thither still, as the rest graze by,</l>
<l>The elder dams repair,</l>
<l>And after each one her lamb doth run</l>
<l>To frisk in so fresh a lair.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>9.</head>
<lg><l>And thither too, at their pattering heels,</l>
<l>His hate the Boy hath brought:</l>
<l>And now on the doomed Lamb he steals --</l>
<l>He pounces -- and 'tis caught!</l>
<l>Then stooping, he his form conceals,</l>
<l>And ponders, pale with thought.</l></lg>

<head>10.</head>
<lg><l>But suddenly a darksome glee</l>
<l>Glooms outward from his mind,</l>

</div>

<pb n="101" facs="A89/00000105.jpg"/>
<div>
<head>11.</head>
<lg><l>And the dark like a pall down over all</l>

<l>And only its own little self so white</l>
<l>To behold in the boundless gloom of night,</l>
<l>How shall it madden with affright</l>
<l>In that so lonesome lair?</l>
<l>That terrible Boy, in his cruel joy,</l>
<l>Ah! can he leave it there?</l></lg>

<lg><l>The dams have left it every one,</l>

<l>That cruel Lad, however bad,</l>
<l>Ah! can he leave it so?</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>13.</head>
<lg><l>He can! he <hi rend="ul">will</hi>! and homeward still</l>

<l>For a good day's work is done.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>14.</head>
<lg><l>But from the settling Flock, ere long,</l>
<l>Did he begin to mind,</l>
<l>How oft one strong bleat -- sorrow-strong,</l>
<l>Went out in the hollow wind:</l>
<l>And shaking his head, the old Man said</l>
<l>We have left a lamb behind.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>15.</head>
<lg><l>And then the <del><unclear/></del><add>the wrong the Boy</add> had done</l>
<l>Did sorely against him plead!</l>
<l>Darkly he supped apart, to shun</l>
<l>The thoughtful Shepherd's heed:</l>
<l>For at each long bleat, the block-raised slab</l>
<l>He sate on, jarred, as it fain would blab</l>
<l>The tale of his wicked deed.</l></lg>

<div>
<head>Part III.</head>
<div>
<head>1.</head>
<lg><l>All through the forewatch of the night</l>
<l>That mournful Mother's wail,</l>
<l>Did thus reproach his cruel spite</l>
<l>Till in the dying gale,</l>
<l>Out desolately far, he thought</l>
<l>Her Lamb's faint voice he also caught,</l>
<l>And his conscience then like a Fury wrought,</l>
<l>And his wilful heart did quail.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>2.</head>
<lg><l>And so, all in the dead midnight</l>
<l>Unto himself he said,</l>
<l>I'll fatch it home! -- His heart grew bright,</l>
<l>For Mercy is ever a spirit of light,</l>
<l>And he leaped from his thorny bed --</l>
<l>But to stand aghast as if stricken fast</l>
<l>Into cold stone with dread!</l></lg>
<l><add>3.</add></l>
<l><add>For</add></l>
</div>
<pb n="104" facs="A89/00000108.jpg"/>
<div>
<head>3.</head>
<lg><l>For sees he not in the lightless room</l>
<l>The Victim of his spite!</l>
<l>But never might gleam in the solid gloom</l>
<l>A living Lamb so white!</l>
<l>And there is the power of some terrible doom</l>
<l>In the glow of its eyes so bright!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>4.</head>
<lg><l>Breathless, pulseless, long he stared!</l>
<l>Long, ghostly stiff, he stood!</l>
<l>When from the hearth on a sudden flared</l>
<l>From the covered and smouldering wood,</l>
<l>A wild flash of light on that Spectre so white --</l>
<l>And lo, from its side ran blood!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>5.</head>
<lg><l>While in the dark, out o'er the roof,</l>
<l>Was heard a low wild moan,</l>
<l>As of a Spirit there aloof</l>
<l>In misery and alone:</l>
<l>A hollow sound, that, wasting, went</l>
<l>Away into the firmament:</l>
<pb n="105" facs="A89/00000109.jpg"/>
<l>And the Boy shut fast his eyes at last,</l>
<l>And heaved a fearful groan.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>6.</head>
<lg><l>Then blindly staggering back to bed,</l>
<l>On the old Man loud he cried;</l>
<l>Who, starting from his calm sleep, sped</l>
<l>In wonder to his side,</l>
<l>And there learned all as it did befall,</l>
<l>And where the Lamb was tied.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>7.</head>
<lg><l>Straightway his clothes he hurried on,</l>
<l>And <del><unclear/></del> hurried at once away,</l>
<l>That good old Man: and as alone</l>
<l>The quietly Urchin lay,</l>
<l>An age of fear, it seemed, had fled</l>
<l>In darkness by, ere the Shepherd's tread</l>
<l>Was heard again, a loudening plain</l>
<l>Upon the homeward way.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>8.</head>
<lg><l>And then, as past the Fold in sight</l>
<l>He came, thus spake the ancient Wight:</l>
<pb n="106" facs="A89/00000110.jpg"/>
<l>Alas, for thee, poor dam!</l>
<l>Some evil Creature of the night</l>
<l>Hath slain thy pretty Lamb!</l>
<l>All torn I found it where 'twas tied --</l>
<l>Oh,God! the listening Boy out cried,</l>
<l>The murderer that I am!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>9.</head>
<lg><l>Yes, thou done a fearful deed,</l>
<l>The old Man made reply;</l>
<l>And to the Lord of all hast need</l>
<l>With a contrite heart to cry,</l>
<l>Till sorrow true and penance due</l>
<l>Win pardon from on high.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>10.</head>
<lg><l>Yet lie not moaning there, my son,</l>
<l>But up, and get thee drest,</l>
<l>And rouse the Flock with the rousing sun,</l>
<l>For of all ways, the best</l>
<l>To pay for the wrong thou'st done to <hi rend="ul">one</hi>,</l>
<l>Is justice to the rest.</l></lg>

</div>
<pb n="107" facs="A89/00000111.jpg"/>
<div>
<head>11.</head>
<lg><l>But he had sickened -- and <del><unclear/></del> his bed</l>
<l>Kept many a day and night:</l>
<l>And oft -- See there again! he said,</l>
<l>It cometh, ghostly white!</l>
<l>There in the <del>gloom</del><add>depth</add> of the <del>darkening</del><add>lighter</add> <del><unclear/></del> room,</l>
<l><del>Which is pierced</del><add>Piercing the <del>long</del>night's <add>long</add> settled gloom</add> with <add>the glow of</add>its eyes so bright!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>12.</head>
<lg><l>Thus lay he -- till his heart did break</l>
<l>Into a wondrous prayer,</l>
<l>That God the Father of all would take</l>
<l>Sweet pity upon him for sorrow's sake,</l>
<l>Thus lowly lying there!</l>
<l>Nor let the wrong that he had done,</l>
<l>Being tempted of the Evil One,</l>
<l>Some deadlier fruit yet bear!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>13.</head>
<lg><l>And when he had prayed, he felt, he said,</l>
<l>Some mystic Presence bright</l>
<l>Burn downward, as from heaven, on spread</l>
<l>And healing wings of light,</l>
<l><add>And</add></l>
<pb n="108" facs="A89/00000112.jpg"/>
<l>And turn to a holy hope the dread</l>
<l>That came with the darksome night!</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>14.</head>
<lg><l>And thereupon, all suddenly</l>
<l>He rose, from sickness freed,</l>
<l>And shouted -- "<hi rend="ul">Now</hi> I know for me</l>
<l>That Mercy herself shall plead,</l>
<l>Till sorrow true and penance due</l>
<l>Annul my sinful deed!"</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>15.</head>
<lg><l>And first this burthen did he lay</l>
<l>Upon himself that night:</l>
<l>Whenever a Lamb should chance to stray,</l>
<l>Chance often as it might,</l>
<l>He'd neither rest nor quit the quest</l>
<l>Until the morrow's light.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>16.</head>
<lg><l>Still sometimes o'er his conscious ear</l>
<l>Long after there would come,</l>
<l>A long bleat, sorrowful and drear,</l>
<l>Announcing through the gloom</l>
<pb n="109" facs="A89/00000113.jpg"/>
<l>That Spectre Lamb so thoroughly white</l>
<l>And wondrous to behold.</l>
<l>As erst it met his fated sight,</l>
<l>And reproached his soul with its eyes so bright</l>
<l>In the Lodge at the old Sheep-fold.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>17.</head>
<lg><l>And then with a most contrite heart</l>
<l>And fervent would he pray,</l>
<l>To see the Phantom at once dispart,</l>
<l>Shot through with a golden ray,</l>
<l>As shred into air is a mist wreath rare</l>
<l>By the first long beam of day.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>18.</head>
<lg><l>Thus came, thus vanished, to the last,</l>
<l>The Spetre of this wild rhyme:</l>
<l>But ever as it were wasting fast,</l>
<l>Paler and fainter it came and past</l>
<l>At each recurring time,</l>
<l>Till sorrow true and penance due</l>
<l>Had cleansed him of his crime.</l></lg>

<l>When my full strength was like a lion's, -- roused</l>
<l>Forth from his lair, being menaced from without;</l>
<l>My fleetness like a roe's, -- when on the hills</l>
<l>In all the wild exultancy of flight,</l>
<l>Seen bounding. But my weary head is now,</l>
<l>Like Winter, white and bleak -- and where the while</l>

<l>The <del><unclear/></del> promised glory of my manhood -- where?</l>
<l>Hark! as if Nature for her lost child yet</l>
<l>Were mourning through the wide world unconsoled,</l>
<l>An Echo from the mountain with a far</l>
<l>And shuddering intonation, answers Where?</l></lg>

<lg><l>Since in the triumph of the Harvest Home</l>
<l>Amongst the virgins I beheld her last,</l>
<l>Glow, dancing, -- like a peerless star amid</l>

<l>The sparkling throngs of heaven, -- how many years</l>
<l>Have joined their shadowy portions to the Past,</l>
<l>And all that weary time have I been thus</l>
<l>In heart alone! For in her Father's house</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>Myrza</add> died early. Into the cruel grave</l>
<l>In all her maiden happiness she fell.</l></lg>

<lg><l>To-day I called her mine: To-morrow came,</l>
<l>And who might then dispute her with the dark</l>
<l>And clammy Grave's white worm? Down with her went</l>
<l>All my life's richness, like a sunset, drawn</l>
<l>For ever down into the dark of time!</l>
<l>Oh! what a vacuum of the world it made --</l>
<l>A drear dull-aching emptiness -- to know</l>
<l>That never her glad-coming step again</l>
<l>Might call out rapture from my listening heart,</l>
<l>Even as an Echo from her silent cell,</l>
<l>In happy wonder, with a wild throb, leaps;</l>
<l><del>To meet</del><add>Meeting</add> the life-<del><unclear/></del><add>stir</add> that comes beating up</l>
<l>Out of green pastures <del>,</del> wakened by the Morn;</l>
<l>Or make my soul, through its serenest depths,</l>
<l>To shudder with a pleasure so extreme</l>
<l>That it resembled pain. Yet through long years</l>
<l>Have worn me with their cold and constant drip</l>
<pb n="112" facs="A89/00000116.jpg"/>
<l>Of joyless day on day, from youth to age,</l>

<l>Her form is pictured on my eyelids yet</l>

<l>To close them, to behold it in the blank</l>
<l>That then were else around me. In the fresh</l>
<l>And sweet-voiced Spring she died -- and never more</l>
<l>Came Spring to me! Its freshness with her bloom.</l>
<l>Had faded, and its once-glad melody marked</l>
<l>Only the loss of her harmonious breath.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Like clusters of the vine, when in the light</l>
<l>They gleam with ripeness, in bright masses hung</l>
<l>The curled glories of her graceful head:</l>
<l>While, under silk-smooth brows, her azure eyes</l>
<l>Yearned deep as the blue dome of heaven, unfilmed</l>
<l>Even with a summer cloud; -- serenely blue,</l>
<l>Yet glowing <del>,</del> like moist violets, when the sun</l>
<l>First steppeth out from some let eastern steep --</l>
<l>Out into space, and while the globy dews,</l>
<l>The unbought jewels of the morn<del>ing</del>, yet flame</l>
<l><del>Flame in</del><add>In all</add> their fleeting beauty. Like two gardens</l>

<l>Upon the slope sides of a sunny hill,</l>
<l>When Summer flushes with her earliest fruits,</l>
<l>And mated wild birds warble. And most like</l>
<l>A singing bird of price within a cage</l>
<l>Of ivory, curtained with a crimson blind,</l>
<l>To hide it, when 'twas meet, from eyes prophane,</l>
<l>Her well-taught tongue discoursed delectable melody</l>
<l>In the sweet prison of her gracious mouth.</l>
<l>Nor sweeter than her breath itself was, are</l>
<l>The fragrant pantings of a wakening breeze,</l>
<l>Which after soft and shiny <del><unclear/></del><add>showers</add> have wept</l>
<l>With a bright passing grief, the flowery death</l>
<l>And burial of the love-remembered Spring,</l>
<l>Out of some bowery maze comes like her soul</l>
<l>Effusing from the earth. Her shapely neck</l>
<l>Was as a shaft of polished alabaster</l>
<l>Having a spirit of warm life within --</l>
<l>As smooth-wrought milky marble, with a quick</l>
<l>Rich flow of blood in its blue-branching viens.</l>
<l>Her gentle breasts, secretively beneath</l>
<l>Their silken robe, were like a downy pair</l>
<l>Of nestling turtle doves, -- there, in their soft</l>
<l>And innocent concealment breathing both</l>
<l>So warmly. And her ever agile motion</l>
<pb n="114" facs="A89/00000118.jpg"/>
<l>Was as the pacing of a glad gazelle --</l>
<l>One of a year old that hath never looked</l>
<l>From out the secret places of the hills</l>
<l>Upon the hunter's form; and thence hath nought</l>
<l>In all its happy attitudes to hint</l>
<l>Infirmity of <del><unclear/></del><add>impulse</add> or of will --</l>
<l>Nothing betokening a doubt-shadowed life,</l>
<l>Or conscious lapse of peace.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Thus richly meet</l>
<l>And beautifully blooming to the eye,</l>
<l>Was Myrza! And no guile, no evil, lurked</l>
<l>Like a bowered serpent hid in flowers, beneath</l>
<l>Those visible graces: for her young desires</l>
<l>Were utterly innocent, -- like a troop of lambs,</l>
<l>When briskly gathered in a snowy knot</l>
<l>Out of the mother flock, it streameth then</l>
<l>Along the green bank of some pleasant brook,</l>
<l>That spends in shady Abana its cool</l>
<l>And murmurous life. -- But what indeed availed</l>
<l>Her innocence, her tenderness, and all</l>
<l>Her wondrous beauty? In her Father's house</l>
<l>Early she died. Into the cruel grave</l>
<l>Even in her maiden happiness she fell!</l>
<pb n="115" facs="A89/00000119.jpg"/>
<l>And I, her chosen one, with time and grief</l>
<l>Thus bleached and broken, -- am not I the slave</l>
<l>Of tasking strangers in an alien land.</l></lg>

<lg><l>In the deep sacred solitude of night</l>
<l>A solemn Vision, like a sudden cloud,</l>
<l>Shadowed my soul. Loved voices and far tones</l>
<l>Flowed as if breathing out of the dead Past,</l>
<l>Over my heart, -- till, with a dim dread joy,</l>
<l>I felt a sweet in the near gloom beside my bed,</l>
<l>Stilly and tall: -- and when I thither looked,</l>
<l>'Twas Myrza! the beloved of my youth,</l>
<l>Even as in her lifetime she had stood</l>
<l>Beside me oft in Abana; -- the same!</l>
<l>Save that her sweet face now looked wildly wan,</l>
<l>And that her dove-like eyes, with moveless lids,</l>
<l>Shone fixed and gleamy, as still waters shine</l>
<l>Under their palmy fringes. Forth I stretched</l>
<l>My arms -- but empty on my yearning breast</l>
<l>Together fell they, folded! and again</l>
<l>The wary weight of many lonesome years</l>
<l>Rolled whelming, like a monstrous wave of pain,</l>
<l>Back on my heart. The white and solemn light</l>
<pb n="116" facs="A89/00000120.jpg"/>
<l>Of the cold midnight Moon came slanting through</l>
<l>The lattice from a lurid cloud's lit verge;</l>
<l>The mixing murmurs of the wind grew loud</l>
<l>Amongst the sycamores beyond the brook,</l>
<l>Whose voice rose sobbing, stronglier it seemed,</l>
<l>Under that leafy turmoil; while through all,</l>
<l>A sudden bleating from the hill-side fold</l>
<l>Poured troublous down; and at the gate my dog</l>
<l>Howled <del><unclear/></del><add>wildly</add>, -- <add>howled</add> as if, even over him,</l>
<l>As over me, the Spirit of the Past,</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>While <del><unclear/></del> it went sorrowing</add> through the hollow dark,</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>Had swept too,</add> wail-like, -- <del><unclear/></del><add>leaving, when it <del><unclear/></del></add> sunk</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>Into some doom-depth infinitely out,</add></l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>A sole sad</add> sense of <add>utter</add> loss behind.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Let me gaze westward, where she keeps afar</l>
<l>The sabbath silence of her early grave!</l>
<l>Let me gaze westward, where that sacred spot<del>,</del></l>
<l>In the warm Springtime <del>,</del> takes the morning's glance,</l>

<head>The Cloud. <add>X</add></head>
<lg><l>One Summer morn, out of the sea waves wild</l>
<l>A speck-like cloud, the season's fatal child,</l>
<l>Came <del>gladly gliding</del><add>softly floating</add> up the <del>broad blue</del><add>boundless</add> sky,</l>
<l>And o'er the sun-parched hills all brown and dry.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Onward she glided, through the azure air</l>
<l>Borne by its motion without toil or care;</l>
<l>When looking down in her ethereal joy</l>
<l>She marked Earth's moilers at their hard employ:</l>
<l>And oh, (she cried) that by some act of grace</l>
<l>'Twere mine to succor yon load-wearied race,</l>
<l>To give the hungry food, the thirsty drink --</l>
<l>The thought of good is very sweet to think.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The day advanced -- and the Cloud greater grew,</l>
<l>And greater still; and her desire to do</l>
<l>Some charity to man<del>kind</del> <add>had</add>, more and more</l>
<l>As the long arid Summer day on wore,</l>
<l>Greatened and warmed within her fleecy breast</l>
<l>Like a dove fledging in its downy nest.</l></lg>
<pb n="118" facs="A89/00000122.jpg"/>
<lg><l>The heat waxed fiercer, until all the land</l>
<l>Glared in the sun's rays like a mighty brand.</l>
<l>Ill could Earth's <del>children their long toil endure</del><add>sons endure their toilsome state</add></l>
<l>Though still they <del>toiled</del><add>labored</add>, for <del>they were very poor</del><add>their need was great.</add></l>
<l>And many a look, with many a sigh, they sped</l>
<l>Tow'rds <del>yon</del><add>that</add> fair Cloud; -- beseeching looks, that said</l>
<l>We famish for thy help! For pity's sake,</l>
<l>Oh, break thou! in a showery blessing break!</l></lg>

<lg><l>I <hi rend="ul">feel</hi>, and I <hi rend="ul">would</hi> help you! said the Cloud,</l>
<l>And tow'rds the Earth her bounteous being bowed.</l>
<l>But then rememb'ring a tradition she</l>
<l>Had, while a child, learned from her native sea,</l>
<l>That when a Cloud adventures from the skies</l>
<l>Too near the altars of the hills -- it <hi rend="ul">dies</hi>!</l>
<l>Awhile she wavered, and was blown about,</l>
<l>Hither and thither, by the winds of doubt.</l>
<l>But in the midst of Heaven at length all still</l>
<l>She stood, and said within herself, I <hi rend="ul">will</hi>!</l>
<l>Yea, in the glad strength of devotion, I</l>
<l>Will help you, though, in helping you, I <hi rend="ul">die</hi>.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Filled with this thought's divinity, the Cloud</l>
<l>Grew world-like vast, as earthward more she bowed!</l>

<l>Oh, never erewhile had she <del>dreamt</del><add><del>guessed</del></add> her state</l>
<l>So great might be -- <unclear/> great!</l>
<l>O'er the parched fields in her angelic love,</l>
<l>She spread her wings out like a brooding dove:</l>
<l>Till, as her purpose deepened, drawing near,</l>
<l>So god-like terrible did her <del>face</del><add>front</add> appear,</l>
<l>That men and beasts all trembled at the view,</l>
<l>And the woods bowed, -- through well all creatures knew</l>
<l>That near in her, to every kind the same,</l>
<l>A great predestined Benefactor came.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Yea, I will help you! said the Cloud again:</l>
<l>Receive me -- lo, I die for you -- <hi rend="ul">in rain</hi>!</l>
<l>Suddenly flashed then through her full-grown form</l>

<l>Of <del>that contentious with <unclear/></del><add>Life's <del>self-<unclear/> to</del>-- dire -- dread of Death, whose mortal threat</add></l>
<l><del>Which was in Christ's <unclear/></del><add>From Christ's great heart itself, drew memorable sweat!</add></l>
<l>Flashed, seething out of rents amid her heaps</l>
<l><ref target="A89-00000123">*</ref>Of lowering gloom, and thence with arrowy leaps</l>
<l>Hissed jagging downward, till a sheety glare</l>
<l>Illumined all the illimtable air!</l>
<l>The thunder followed, a tremendous sound</l>
<l>Loud doubling and reverbaerating round,</l>

<l>Through all the shuddering mountains manifold!</l>
<l>Strong was her will, but stronger yet the power</l>
<l>Of love that now dissolved her in a shower,</l>
<l>Dropping in blessings, to impregn the earth</l>
<l>With health and plenty at one booming birth.</l>
<l>She bled in rain, bled unto death, but died</l>
<l>Only to higher being -- Good beatified!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Far as the rain extended o'er the Land</l>
<l>A spledndid bow the freshened prospect spann'd,</l>
<l>As the last greeting of the spirit pure</l>
<l>Of Love self-sacrificed, and thence made sure,</l>

<div>

<lg><l>Full in the centre of a region named</l>
<l>The Land of Vain Display, a mansion stands,</l>
<l>Built by debauched artificers of old</l>
<l>For prodigal Pleasure in her palmiest days,</l>
<l>The foundress vain of a vain-glorious race,</l>
<l>Profuse though needy, arrogant <del><unclear/></del><add>though</add> light</l>
<l>And loose of life, and always in their day</l>
<l>As greedy of prominence as void of worth.</l>
<l>A structure large, and splendid to the eye,</l>
<l>Pillared and porched, but meretricious more</l>
<l>Than graceful in its style, -- with gilded domes,</l>
<l>And glittering pinnacles that flash aloft</l>
<l>Like giant lances pointed at the sky,</l>
<l>And carven windows in their ribbed rows blazing</l>
<l>O'er the long colonades. A Mansion large</l>
<l>And solid in its seeming still it stands;</l>
<l>But inwardly impaired and worn is now</l>
<l>The whole huge structure; in its basement most --</l>
<l>Knawed through with damps and crumbling unrenewed.</l></lg>

<lg><l>That is the House of Riot: the set place</l>
<l>Of much vain speech and simulated mirth,</l>
<l>(For true Mirth seldom quits her sylvan lodge)</l>
<l>And fleshly feasting. From its unblest door</l>
<l>Simplicity, and Strength, and red-lipped Health,</l>
<l>And native Cheerfulness, and staunch Resolve,</l>
<l>Wise Care, and Prudence, and domestic Peace,</l>
<l>And Piety who loves with these to dwell,</l>

<l>And false Refinement, sensually nice</l>
<l>But vulgar and indelicate of soul;</l>
<l>And Infidelity; and the gamester Craft</l>
<l>Dressed in the airs and habit of a sage;</l>

<l>That he who in the morning of his life</l>
<l>Good counsel scorns -- indubitably good,</l>

<l>And vain Remorse, and outcast Poverty,</l>
<l>Under the lengthening shadows that portend</l>
<l>Its sunset, ending in the dark of <del>night</del><add>death</add>.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Oh, we should honor Wisdom, since through her</l>
<l>The all-contriving One designed and built</l>

<l>Glanced the sun on his imperial course,</l>

<head><add>Final copy</add>The Dream by the Fountain.</head>
<lg><l>Thought-weary and sad, I lay down by a Fountain</l>
<l>At the head of a white-cedar shaded ravine,</l>
<l>And the breeze that fell over the high-glooming mountain</l>
<l>Sang a lullaby low as I gazed o'er the Scene.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Long I'd reclined not till slumber came o'er me,</l>
<l>Grateful as balm to a suffering child:</l>
<l>When a lofty-souled Maiden seemed standing before me</l>
<l>With a lyre in her hand -- O so sounding and wild!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Bright was her brow, not the morning's brow brighter,</l>
<l>But her eyes were two midnights of passionate thought;</l>
<l>Light was her motion, a breeze's not lighter,</l>
<l>And her locks were like sunshine and shadow inwrought.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Never before did my bosom inherit</l>
<l>Emotion so thrilling, such exquisite awe!</l>
<l>Never such wonder exalted my spirit</l>
<l>Before, as did now, through the Vision I saw.</l></lg>
<pb n="134" facs="A89/00000138.jpg"/>
<lg><l>Robed for the chase like a Nymph of Diana,</l>
<l>Her ivory limbs were half given below, --</l>
<l>Bare, that the pure breath of heaven might fan her,</l>
<l>Bare was her bosom of roseate snow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then lifting the lyre, and with every feeling</l>
<l>Sublimed as with love, she awakened the strings:</l>
<l>Bliss followed -- and half into being came stealing</l>
<l>The motion and light of angelical wings.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Divine were the measures! Each voice of the wildwood</l>
<l>Seem'd gathering head in their musical thrills --</l>
<l>The loud joy of streams in their <del>glad</del><add>strong</add> mountain childhood,</l>
<l>The shouting of Echoes that look from the hills;</l></lg>

<lg><l>The moaning of trees all at midnight in motion</l>
<l>When the breezes seem lost in the dark, with a rare</l>
<l>And sweet meaning spirit of human devotion</l>
<l>All blend<del>ing</del><add>ed</add> and woven together were there!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Ceased then the strain: and as soon as were flowing</l>

<p>It has been pointed out to me, that there is some resemblance between<lb/> the manner of this phase of the Vision and that of a similar one in Shelley's Alastor.<lb/> But whatever likeness there may have chanced to be between them, my draught cannot<lb/> possibly be any copy of his, for the simple but sufficient reason, that up to the time of conceiving<lb/> it, and for long after, though I may have heard of Shelley as a writer, I had never read<lb/> a line of his writings. My acquaintance with these began as late as in 1842 or 43 --<lb/> namely, on the occasion of Mr. Henry Parkes sending me as a present, far into the interior,<lb/> a copy of Mrs. Shelley's edition of <unclear/>, in six volumes.</p>

<lg><l>High 'mid the shelves of a grey Cliff, that yet</l>
<l>Hangeth <del><unclear/></del> in bluffs enormously above,</l>
<l>In a benched cleft, as in the mouldered chair</l>
<l>Of greybeard Time himself, I sit alone,</l>
<l>And gaze with a keen wondering happiness</l>
<l>Out o'er the Sea. Immensely rolling forth,</l>
<l>See how it stretches to the circling bend</l>
<l>That verges Heaven: -- a vast luminous plain</l>
<l>Of waters, changeful as a lover's dream!</l>
<l>Into great spaces mapped by light and shade</l>
<l>In constant interchange, or under clouds</l>
<l>The billows darken, or they simmer bright</l>
<l>In sunny scopes of measureless expanse!</l>
<l>'Tis Ocean dreamless of a stormy hour,</l>
<l>Calm, or but gently heaving; -- yet, O God!</l>
<l>What a blind fate-like mightiness lies coiled</l>
<l>In slumber, under that wide-shining face!</l>
<l>While o'er the watery gleam, -- there, where its edge</l>
<l>Banks the dim vacancy, the topmost sails</l>
<l>Of some tall Ship whose hull is yet unseen,</l>
<pb n="139" facs="A89/00000143.jpg"/>
<l>Hang, as if clinging to a cloud that still</l>
<l>Comes rising with them from the void beyond,</l>
<l>And bellying over, -- like a heavenly net</l>
<l>Drawn slowly upward by ethereal hands.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And if I look aloft, how deep the sky</l>
<l>That arches Ocean! -- depper far, it seems,</l>
<l>Than elsewhere. See how delicately rare</l>
<l>Are those sky colors that keep flickering up</l>
<l>From the remote horizon! Beautiful</l>
<l>Those lucid traceries of woven cloud</l>
<l>That float about the sun; and lustrous too</l>
<l>Are the white masses overheard, that move</l>
<l>And gather inland tow<del>a</del>'rds the verdant hills.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Withdrawing now the eye from heaven, behold</l>
<l>The Coast, how wonderful! Proportions strange,</l>
<l>And unimaginable forms, more quaint,</l>
<l>More wild and wayward than were ever dreamt</l>
<l>By a mad architect, keep crowding out</l>
<l>As runs the eye along it. Semblances</l>
<l>Of pyramidic structures vague and rent,</l>
<l>Hunch ledging stairwise from the general range;</l>
<l>Or dark time-wasted columns, leaning out</l>
<pb n="140" facs="A89/00000144.jpg"/>
<l>Under the bluffs, and in their seeming such</l>
<l>As old Assyrian trowels might have reared,</l>
<l>Support fantastic arches. Rugged domes,</l>
<l>And minarets in ruin, freak the sides</l>
<l>Of chasms spann'd by crude and haggard bridges;</l>
<l>Or overhanging Cliffs like this whose shelf</l>
<l>Sustains me, rest on buttresses of more</l>
<l>Than Babylonian vastness; -- while below,</l>
<l>Against their bases everlastingly</l>
<l>Beats the white wrath of the relentless surge.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Yet even amid these rugged forms the warm</l>
<l>And gentle ministry of Spring hath wrought</l>
<l>Its work of love. Most sparingly indeed,</l>
<l>But thence most gratefully, a nameless shrub</l>
<l>With flame-bright blossom, tufts each guttered ledge</l>
<l>That holds a scanty soil; and rarer still,</l>
<l>Green runners from some sheltering crevice throw</l>
<l>Their tendrils o'er the shelves, and trailing thence</l>
<l>Touch the stern faces of the rocks with beauty.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Nor wants the scene its meet inhabitants.</l>
<l>Below the porpoise breaches, and the crab</l>
<l>Waits for his prey amid the wave-washed stones</l>
<pb n="141" facs="A89/00000145.jpg"/>
<l>That glisten to the sun, -- gleaming himself</l>
<l>Whene'er he moves, as if his wetted shell</l>
<l>Were breaking into flame; or more remote,</l>
<l>Out in the watery spaces may be seen</l>
<l>Some solitary diver's shining back.</l>
<l>Sea-gulls go clanging by, and overhead</l>
<l>Sits the white-breasted hawk, with many a sleek</l>
<l>And silver pinioned wanderer in the winds</l>
<l>That furrow the great visage of the Deep,</l>
<l>And who, in conjugal convention met,</l>
<l>Hoard here their mottled eggs and rear their young</l>
<l>Amongst the jags and fissures of the Cliffs.</l></lg>

<lg><l>How nourishing is Nature to the soul</l>
<l>That loves her well! not only as she acts</l>
<l>In instant contact with its quickened powers,</l>
<l>But as she tempers all its aftermoods</l>
<l>Through oldest memories and remotest tokens.</l>
<l>And hence, when thus beloved, not only here</l>
<l>By the great Sea, or amid forests wild,</l>
<l>Or pastures luminous with lakes, is she</l>
<l>A general luminous with lakes, is she</l>

<l>Dead city walls may pen us in, but still</l>

<l>With instincts which regenerated thus,</l>

<l>(As some suppose) the thin disjoining shades</l>
<l>Of facts and feelings long foregone or late,</l>
<l>As <del>gathered</del><add>recomposed</add>, and <del>disposed</del><add>put</add> in ghostly act</l>
<l>And strange procession, wildly mixed, and yet</l>
<l>So life-like, though thus composite and wild,</l>
<l>By wakeful Fancy, --<del>in her mimic mood</del><add>when alone awake</add></l>
<l><add>And thence unhindered in her mimic craft,</add></l>
<l><del>Tracking</del><add>She tracks</add> the vaguer drifts of wearied Thought,</l>
<l>Itself sunk sleepward? Wonderful no less</l>
<l>Are they though thus be true; and wondrous more</l>
<l>Is she who in the dark, and stripped of sense,</l>
<l>Can claim such sovereignty -- the Queen of Art!</l>
<l>For what a cunning painter is she then,</l>
<l>And sculptor, who, in bodying from the waste</l>
<l>Of things memorial littering life's dim floor,</l>
<l>The forms and features manifold and quaint</l>
<l>That crowd the timeless vistas of a Dream,</l>
<pb n="151" facs="A89/00000155.jpg"/>
<l>Fails never in a stroke, and breathes as well</l>
<l>A spirit of motion into all her work --</l>
<l>The test of deity; -- inspiring too</l>
<l>Her phantom creatures with more eloquent tones</l>
<l>Than ever broke in subtle waves, like light,</l>
<l>Upon a waking ear?</l></lg>

<lg><l>But are they more?</l>
<l>Sure glimpses oft, though vague, of some wide sea</l>
<l>Of mystic being, on whose lonely shore</l>
<l>Things mortal terminate; and where the pent</l>
<l>Impatient Soul <del>,</del> from its sleep-shrouded crib</l>
<l>Slipping sometimes, is wont to roam at large,</l>
<l>Like Crusoe, staring forth; or musing stand</l>
<l>As once the intelligence of Newton stood</l>
<l>Upon the shores of Time, while the great deep</l>
<l>Of Nature, yet untried, around it loomed</l>
<l>Illimitably out.<add>Under <del>heaven's</del>the uncommunicable <del>dome,</del> sky</add></l></lg>

<lg><l>But vain is all</l>
<l>Conjecture: they are Dreams! and wonderful,</l>
<l>However we may rank them in our lore.</l>
<l>And worthy well <del>a</del><add>some</add> passing thought are <del>things</del>states</l>
<l>Of our interior being, though aberrant,</l>
<pb n="152" facs="A89/00000156.jpg"/>
<l>That with a wand so capable can bring</l>
<l>Back to the faded heart <del>,</del> the rosy flush</l>
<l>And sweetness of a long fled love, or touch</l>
<l>The eyes of an old enmity with tears</l>
<l>Of a yet older friendship; or restore</l>
<l>A world-lost mate, or reunite in joy</l>
<l>The living and the dead! Yet this can Dreams:</l>
<l>And more as wonderful; -- can, when so wills</l>
<l>Their wand's weird wielder, whatsoe'er it be,</l>
<l>Lift up the fallen -- fall'n however low!</l>
<l>Rejuvenate the worn; enrich the poor;</l>
<l>The past imparadise, and enchant the present;</l>
<l>Build in the future higher than the hope</l>
<l>Of Power, when boldest, ever dared to soar;</l>
<l>Annul <del>,</del> as with the sanction of the Infinite,</l>
<l>The prison bars of place, the dens of time</l>
<l>Giving the rigid and dull-clanking chain</l>
<l>Which Force, that grey inequity, hath clenched</l>
<l>About its captive, to relent, -- yea, stretch</l>
<l>Out into Fairy-land; or melt like wax</l>
<l>In that fierce life <del>which</del><add>whose spirit</add> lightens wide <del><unclear/></del></l>
<l>Round Freedom <del>,</del> seated on his mountain throne!</l>
<l>Or witching Memory, where she darkling lies,</l>
<l>Can so accomplish her <del>,</del> that she can make</l>
<pb n="153" facs="A89/00000157.jpg"/>
<l>All brute bulk ocular, <del>and</del><add>or the great earth itself</add> spread her wings</l>
<l><del>Over a whole life time</del><add>Diaphanous, like a mighty globe of glass</add><add>Hung in the void of time</add><add>Overall ages</add> -- as from east to west</l>
<l>Evolve at once the wings of morn, and show</l>
<l>All things beneath them in one world-wide act,</l>
<l>Instant and universal! -- Wonderful!</l></lg>

<lg><l>But not this always are our dreams benign:</l>
<l>Oft are they miscreations -- gloomier worlds</l>
<l>Crowded tempestuosly with Wrongs and Fears</l>
<l>More ghastly than the Actual ever knew;</l>
<l>And rend with racking noises, such as might</l>
<l>If audible ever to a soul awake,</l>
<l>Go thundering only through the wastes of Hell!</l></lg>

<lg><l>So wonderful are Dreams: and I have <del>had</del> known</l>
<l>Many most wild and strange. And once, long since,</l>
<l>As in the death-like mystery of Sleep</l>
<l>My body lay impalled, my soul arose</l>
<l>And journeyed outward in a dream of wonder. --</l>
<l>In the mid hour of a dark night, methought</l>
<l>I roamed the margin of a waveless Lake,</l>
<l>Which, in the knotted forehead of the land</l>
<l>Deep sunken, like a huge <del>Cyclopes</del><add>Cyclopean</add> eye,</l>
<l>Lidless, and void of speculation, stared</l>
<pb n="154" facs="A89/00000158.jpg"/>    
<l>Glassily up, -- for ever sleepless, -- up</l>
<l>At the wide vault of heaven; and that I had</l>
<l>Also a vague and mystic consciousness</l>
<l>That over against me, on the farther shore,</l>
<l>Which yet I might not see, there stood a Tower</l>
<l>Such as we read o in some old romance.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The darkness darkened, until overhead</l>
<l>Solid black the starless heaven domed,</l>
<l>And earth was one wide blot -- where, as I looked,</l>
<l>Suddenly lamping through the hollow dark</l>
<l>A Light swing blazing from the unseen Tower,</l>
<l>(Unseen, though prophesied in imagination)</l>
<l>And brought at once its rounded structure forth</l>
<l>Out of the mighty gloom, wherein, till then,</l>
<l>So shut it seemed as one in substance with it.</l>
<l>And when the Light had steadied, hanging there</l>
<l>Against the grim front of the night-backed Tower,</l>
<l>Suspended as by magic, I might see</l>
<l>In the wide Lake whose whole disc now between</l>
<l>Glimmered though dubiously, the falling stream</l>
<l>Of its wild radiance, columnar and vast,</l>
<l>Reach quivering, -- down, like a great shaft of fire,</l>
<l>Through the lit waters.</l></lg>
<pb n="155" facs="A89/00000159.jpg"/> 
<lg><l>Long in stedfast wonder</l>
<l>It held me gazing, - till I thence could feel</l>
<l>A strange and thrillingly attractive power</l>
<l>In gradual operation; and ere long,</l>
<l>My bodily weight seemed witched away, and up</l>
<l> mounted, poised within the passive air;</l>
<l>Then glode ascendingly sheer o'er the Lake,</l>
<l>Which, far below, as tow'rds the wondrous <hi rend="ul">light</hi></l>
<l>The attraction drew me, I beheld illumed</l>
<l>Even to its sullen depths with shifting beams,</l>
<l>That tangled Tower-ward into one broad path</l>
<l>Of multifarious splendor, -- <hi rend="ul">one</hi> red blaze,</l>
<l>Yet various, wildly interwrithing quick,</l>
<l>As every molecule of the watery mass</l>
<l>Had an organic life, and played a part</l>
<l>Restlessly proper to its wayward self,</l>
<l>Though tending all into one glow of bright</l>
<l>Disunion in bright union.</l></lg>

<lg><l>On I slid:</l>
<l>Nor knew I why -- but my amaze wore off</l>
<l>As thus I glode over the Lake, and still</l>
<l>Approached the Tower and that so wondrous <hi rend="ul">light</hi>!</l>
<l>And soon, instead, a many-branching warmth,</l>
<pb n="156" facs="A89/00000160.jpg"/>
<l>Even like the spirit of new love, began</l>
<l>To tingle in my being: and with this</l>
<l>So sweet conception, -- lo, a beateous change!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Within a circular balcony, whose roof</l>
<l>Was fluted silver, lightly propt on four</l>
<l>Pencil-like shafts of jet, <del>whose</del><add>the</add> polished [<add>rules</add>lines]</l>
<l><add>Of which</add> Descending to an ivory <del>balustrade</del><add>rail</add>,</l>
<l>Glistened in contrast with a covert gleam;</l>
<l>And which, high up the Tower, emporched a huge</l>
<l>And brazen dore, -- behold, a Lady, all</l>
<l>Of light immaculate -- yea, face and form</l>
<l>All of a Hesper radiancy composed,</l>
<l>And lovelier than lustrous, stood alone,</l>
<l>Yet, as it seemed, expectant; for as still</l>
<l>She witched me tow'rds her <del>there</del>, she <add>kept</add> beckoned me</l>
<l>With tiny hand more splendid than a star:</l>
<l><del>Beckoned and smiled</del><add>Beckoning and <hi rend="ul">smiling</hi></add>, -- not as <del>mere</del> mortals use,</l>
<l>With risible throes, local and weak at most, --</l>
<l>But with her while bright influence all at once</l>
<l>In gracious act; as smiles the Morning, when</l>
<l>Its subtle lips in rosy glory part</l>
<l>And <del><unclear/></del> lengthwise redden, under and above</l>
<l>The pearly clouds; -- and with a voice intense</l>
<pb n="157" facs="A89/00000161.jpg"/>
<l>And intimately tender as the first</l>
<l>Fine feeling of a love-born bliss, and oh!</l>
<l>More silvery in its sweetness to the ear's</l>
<l>Internal test, than seemeth to the eye</l>
<l>The wild white radiance of the maiden Moon,</l>
<l>When from some <del><unclear/></del><add>cape's dark beak her rising mass</add></l>
<l><del>Over</del><add>O'erlooks</add> the ocean, -- even with such a voice,</l>
<l>So keen, so silvery, she kept asking aye</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l>I heard -- but felt</l>
<l>Pass from me forth a cry of instant fear,</l>
<l>As swooning through intensity of joy,</l>
<l>Methought I drifted -- whither? All was now</l>
<l>One wide cold blank -- the Lady and the Tower,</l>
<l>The gleaming Lake, <del>and</del><add>with</add> all around it -- one</l>
<l>Wide dreary blank, the drearier for that still</l>
<l>A dizzy, clinging, ghostly consciousness</l>
<l>Kept glimming from mine inmost pulse of life,</l>
<l>Like a far meteor in some dismal marsh:</l>
<l>How long I dreamt not -- but the thrilling warmth</l>
<l>Which, like the new birth of a passionate bliss,</l>
<l>Erewhile had searched me to the quick, again</l>
<l>Shuddered within me, -- more and more, until</l>
<pb n="158" facs="A89/00000162.jpg"/>
<l>Mine eyes had opened under <hi rend="ul">two</hi> that made</l>
<l>All else like darkness; and upon my check</l>
<l>A breath that seemed the final spirit of health</l>
<l>And Floral sweetness, harbingered more near</l>
<l>The fond enquiry of that silver voice</l>
<l>Which once to have heard was never to forget:</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l>And when she thus</l>
<l>Had spoken, there came warbled, as it seemed</l>
<l>In <del><unclear/></del><add>mystical</add> respondence to her voice,</l>
<l>Still music, such as Eolus gives forth,</l>
<l>But purer, deeper; -- warbled as from some</l>
<l>Unsearchable recess of soul supreme --</l>
<l>Some depth of the Eternal! echoing thence</l>
<l>Through the sweet meaning of its spirit-speech,</l>
<l>The fond enquiry that awoke me now:</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l>I answered not,</l>
<l>But followed in mute love her eyes with mine,</l>
<l>As in that balcony which up the Tower</l>
<l>Emporched the brazen door, methought I now</l>
<l>Close at her side reclined upon a couch</l>
<pb n="159" facs="A89/00000163.jpg"/>
<l>Of purple, blazoned all with stars of gold</l>
<l>Tremblingly rayed with speculated gems,</l>
<l>And argent moons, -- and bearing cushions, rough</l>
<l>With sheaves of flowers in glowing tissue wrought.</l>
<l>Thus sat we, looking forth: nor did I marvel</l>
<l>As hers now led my vision, to remark</l>
<l>That the broad Lake, with its green shelving shores</l>
<l>Swarming with flowers, <del>and</del><add>or</add> draped with vines, and thence</l>
<l>The prospect all -- hills, skies, and winding vales,</l>
<l>And bloomy forests of unspeakable beauty,</l>
<l>Were basking in the <del>radiance</del><add>blessedness</add> of a day</l>
<l><del><unclear/> blessedly</del> serene <del>, than ever</del><add>that never</add> yet</l>
<l><add>The perfect <unclear/> of life-essential light</add></l>
<l>Might so enrobe the common world of man</l>
<l>Since Paradise was lost.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I saw all this</l>
<l>Surpassing beauty -- but I saw it thus</l>
<l>Through her superior life, her moon-like sphere</l>
<l>Of being, that seemed the inexhaustible source</l>
<l>(Transpicuously evinced) of breathing thoughts --</l>
<l>Breathing abroad like <del>fragrance</del><add>odors</add> from a flower;</l>
<l>And effluent idealities; and more</l>
<l>Of rosy passion and affectionate joy,</l>
<l>And earnest tenderness, than many souls</l> 
<pb n="160" facs="A89/00000164.jpg"/>
<l>Of Earth's most fervent and ecstatic daughters</l>
<l>United might possess; -- all interflowing</l>
<l>Through the fine issues of a love at once</l>
<l>Wilful and nice, -- but sanctioned none the less</l>
<l>By its so brilliant purity. Nor might</l>
<l>The glassy Lake below <del><unclear/></del><add>more quickly give</add></l>
<l>Nimble impressions of the coming wind's</l>
<l>Invisible footsteps, dimpling swift along,</l>
<l>Than instant tokens of communion sweet</l>
<l>With outward beauty's subtle spirit, passed</l>
<l>Forth from her eyes, and thence in lambent waves</l>
<l>Suffused and lightened o'er the splendid whole</l>
<l>Of her bright visage, or about her head</l>
<l>In spheres ran raying like a glory of bliss!</l></lg>

<lg><l>But as upon the wonder of her beauty</l>
<l>My soul now feasted, even till it seemed</l>
<l>Instinct with kindred lustre, -- lo, her eyes</l>
<l>Suddenly saddened, and abstractedly</l>
<l>Outfixing them as on some far wild thought</l>
<l>That darkened up <del>over our peace</del><add>like a portentous cloud</add><add>Over the morning of our peace</add> she flung</l>
<l>Her silver voice into a mystic song</l>
<l>Of many measures, gathering as they went,</l>
<l>And sliding on -- a sweet abundant flood</l>
<pb n="161" facs="A89/00000165.jpg"/>
<l>Of metric melody! With which, as still</l>
<l>She poured it forth, invisible Singers mixed</l>
<l>A choral burthen that prolonged the strain's</l>
<l>Rich concords, till the echoes of the hills</l>
<l>Came forth in turn, and, flowing off <del>,</del> afar,</l>
<l>Blent all into <hi rend="ul">one</hi> mystery of sound --</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">One</hi> manifold cadence -- dying down. The Song</l>
<l>(Which strangely seemed through all its mystic drift</l>
<l>Addressed to the so stubborn fact <del>,</del> that I</l>
<l>Was sleeping, and its utterer but a Dream!)</l>
<l>Is traced upon the <unclear/> of my soul</l>
<l>In shining lines that intonate themselves --</l>
<l>Not sounding to the ear, but to the thought</l>
<l>Out of the vague vast of the Wonderful!</l>
<l>And might, when hardened into normal speech,</l> 
<l>And narrowed from its wide and various sweep</l>
<l>Into such flows as make our waking rhymes</l>
<l>Most wildly musical, be written thus:</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>The Song.</head>
<lg><l>Wide apart -- wide apart</l>
<l>In old Time's dim heart,</l>
<l>One terrible Fiend doth his grim watch keep</l>
<pb n="162" facs="A89/00000166.jpg"/>
<l>Over the mystery</l>
<l>Lovely and deep,</l>
<l>Locked up in thy history</l>
<l>Beautiful Sleep!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Could we disarm him --</l>
<l>Could we but charm him,</l>
<l>The soul of the sleeper might happily leap</l>
<l>Through the darkness so dreadful -- so deathly and deep,</l>
<l>That shroudeth the triple divinity</l>
<l>Composing thy mystical Trinity:</l>
<l>Liberty, gratitude,</l>
<l>Boundless beatitude:</l>
<l>Beautiful Spirit of Sleep!</l></lg>

<lg><l>Beautiful Spirit of Sleep!</l>

<l>With all that soul, freed from the body's strait scheme,</l>

<l>Into life in the Infinite,</l>
<l>Holy and high,</l>

<head>Part II.</head>
<lg><l>She ceased: and a deep tingled silence fell</l>
<l><del>Into</del> Instantly round; -- silence complete, and yet</l>
<l>Instinct as with a breathing sweetness, left</l>
<l>By the rare spirit of her voice, now hushed:</l>
<l>Even as the fragrance of <del>an exquisite flower</del><add>a flower wore felt</add></l>
<l><del>Is felt in</del><add>Pervaiding</add> the mute air, through which erewhile,</l>

<l>Of some sweet-thoughted maiden. Twining then</l>
<pb n="164" facs="A89/00000168.jpg"/>
<l>Her bright face tow'rds me <del>,</del> as I stood entranced,</l>
<l>Yet with keen wonder stung, she said:</l></lg>

<lg><l>"I love thee,</l>
<l>As first love loveth -- utterly! But ah,</l>
<l>This Love itself -- this purpled-winged Love --</l>
<l>This spirit-sweeting Spirit of delight,</l>
<l>Is but a honey-bee of Paradise,</l>
<l>That only in its morning glory dares</l>
<l>To range abroad -- and when a vagrant most,</l>
<l>Adventure out into the common world</l>
<l>Of Man and Woman! thither lured by sight</l>
<l>Of some sweet human  soul that blooms apart</l>
<l>Untainted by a rank soil's weedy growths; --</l>
<l>Lured thither thus -- yet being, even then,</l>
<l>But wandering wildly, wilfully away</l>
<l>From its pure birth-place, whither it must return,</l>
<l>Or forfeit its celestial passport, ere</l>
<l>The dread night cometh.<ref target="A89-00000168">*</ref>" And with these, her eyes</l>
<l>Ran o'er with lustres as they opened up</l>
<l>Under mine own now melancholy gaze.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And so we stood, turned one unto the other,</l>
<l>Till love again grew glad <del>,</del> even from the rich</l>
<note xml:id="A89-00000168"><l>--Yet of how great worth</l>

<l><add>The charm through which it came. And then, <unclear/>  </add></l>
<pb n="165" facs="A89/00000169.jpg"/>
<l>And wine-like luxury of its own free tears.</l>
<l>Forth then once more we looked -- silently happy.</l>
<l>Alas! not long: for with a short low gasp</l>
<l>Of sudden fear, she started; nor might <del>up</del> I</l>
<l>Stand unalarmed. For hark! within the Tower</l>
<l>A sound of strenuous steps approaching fast</l>
<l>Rang upward, as it seemed, from the hard slabs</l>
<l>Of a steep winding stair; and soon the huge</l>
<l>And brazen portals that behind us shut</l>
<l>Burst open <del>!</del> with a clang of loosened boths --</l>
<l>A clang, like thunder, that went rattling out</l>
<l>Against the echoes of the distant hills.</l></lg>

<lg><l>With deafened ears and looks aghast, I turned</l>
<l>Tow'rds the harsh noise, -- there to behold <del>,</del> between</l>
<l>The brazen jaunts in the tower-wall from which</l>
<l>The door swung inward, a tremendous Form!</l>
<l>A horrid gloomy Form <del>,</del> that shapeless seemed,</l>
<l>And yet in its so monstrous bulk, to Man</l>
<l>A hideous likeness <del><unclear/></del><add>bare</add>! Still more and more</l>
<l>Deformed it grew as forth it swelled, and then</l>
<l>Its outlines, shadowing outward, so were lost</l>
<l>In <del>a</del><add>one</add> dim indistinguishable haze,</l>
<l><del>That</del><add>Which</add> hung around them <del>,</del> even as dull grey clouds.</l>
<l><add>And having said</add></l>
<l><add>These mystical sentenses, so <unclear>sweet and wild</unclear></add></l>
<l><add>And memorably mournful, -- lo, her eyes</add></l>

<l>Beskirt a coming <del>Tempest</del><add>storm hitch</add>, dark itself,</l>

<l>The yet still spirit of the thunder broods,</l>
<l>And menaces the world.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The Lady of Light</l>
<l>Had rushed to my extended arms and hid</l>
<l>Her beamy face, fright-harrowed, in my bosom!</l>
<l>And thus we stood, made one in fear; while still</l>
<l>That terrible Vision <del>not</del><add>in</add> upon us glared</l>
<l>With horny eyes -- the horrider for that</l>
<l>No touch of passion vitalised their fixed</l>
<l>Eumenidian stone-cold stare, as tow'rds</l>

<l>Its pitiless strength along.</l></lg>

<lg><l>With one dark stride</l>
<l>Then glooming forward, and extending straight</l>
<l>One shadowy arm, from my reluctant grasp</l>
<l>It tore the Radiant Lady, muttering: This</l>
<l>Is love forbidden! in a voice whose tones</l>
<l>Were like low thunders ominously heard</l>
<l>Outroaming from the clouded gorges wild</l>
<pb n="167" facs="A89/00000171.jpg"/>
<l>Of neighboring mountaisn, when a <del>summer</del><add>sultry</add> storm</l>

<l>Siezed by the other, I was backward thrown</l>
<l>Within the Tower, and heard ere I could rise</l>
<l>From the cold platform, the huge brazen door</l>
<l>Drawn hoarsly greating to; its beam-like bar</l>
<l>Dropt, with a wall-quake, and <del>its</del><add>the</add> bolts all shot</l>

<l>Could give the self-possession of my soul,</l>
<l>If wide awake.) I listened. All was still!</l>
<l>Within -- without -- all silent, stirless, cold.</l>
<l>What was my doom? And where was she, my late</l>
<l>So luminous delight? Gone! Reft away</l>
<l>So strangely -- terribly! and I myself,</l>
<l>For some all unimaginable cause,</l>
<l>A dungeoned wretch! Time, every deep of which</l>
<l>Was as an age, kept trickling on, but there</l>
<l>Brought no release -- no hope -- not even a breath</l>
<pb n="168" facs="A89/00000172.jpg"/>
<l>That spake of fellowship, or even of life,</l>
<l>Out of myself -- my lonely self! I stood</l>
<l>In marble-cold astonishment of heart,</l>
<l>Utterly blank. And when at length I cast</l>
<l>A desperate look -- so desperate, that the power</l>
<l>Of vision stung me like a deadly curse --</l>
<l>Up and around, pure pity of myself</l>
<l>So warmed and loosened from my brain the pent</l>
<l>And icy anguish, that its load at once</l>
<l>Came, like an alp-thaw, streaming through mine eyes;</l>
<l>Till resignation, that so balm sweet</l>
<l>Meck flower of grief <del>that</del><add>which</add> hath its root in tears</l>
<l>Grew out of mine, and therewith, strength of will</l>
<l>To inspect my Prison.</l></lg>

<lg><l>'Twas a lofty Cell,</l>
<l>Half round, and had within the granite wall</l>
<l>That cut the circle of its floor in twain,</l>
<l>A second door -- shut, and all clamped with <unclear/></l>
<l>And rough with rows of monstrous iron studs,</l>
<l>And which migh haply have thence opened in</l>
<l>Athward some stairway (as I guessed) that led</l>
<l>Down through the Tower; and by the side of this</l>
<l>A winged Steed upon four dragon claws --</l>
<pb n="169" facs="A89/00000173.jpg"/>
<l>A strange, mute, mystic, almost terrible Thing,</l>
<l>Stood rigid, with a tripod near it placed.</l>
<l>Bare were the dull and rugged walls, but pierced</l>
<l>High out of reach by two small ports that looked</l>
<l>Eastward and westward. -- As I noted these</l>
<l>Full on my sight a transcient sunbeam fell</l>
<l>Slantingly through, and glowed on the damp floor,</l>
<l>A moment, like a streak of burning blood,</l>
<l>Then vanished; wherefore in my heart I guessed</l>
<l>That o'er the mountain tops the sun was then</l>
<l>Ocean-ward sinking.</l></lg>

<lg><l>By degrees the night</l>
<l>Came on <del>,</del> and the Cell darkened: yea, I saw</l>
<l>The <del><unclear/></del> Steed and tripod -- all its furniture,</l>
<l>Fade, melting gradually, more and more,</l>
<l>Into the darkness; even as a fish</l>
<l>Through the dense medium of its element</l>
<l>Retiring down, is in its outlines seen</l>
<l>More shadowy -- till 'tis lost. Then all was black.</l>
<l>And <del>two</del> to and fro I paced, hour after hour,</l>
<l>And heard my step, the only sound to me</l>
<l>In th' whole wide world, reverb with a dull blow</l>
<l>Down through the hollow Tower that seemed to yawn</l>
<l>Immeasurably beneath me, -- as it were</l>
<l>A monstrous well, whose wide waste mouth was<lb/> bridged</l>
<l>By that <del><unclear/></del><add>dull-</add>-quaking strip of floor alone</l>
<l>On which I darkling strode; -- yet on I kept</l>
<l>Pacing, though horrified. Hour after hour</l>
<l>Passed <del>,</del> as if clotting at the heart of Time --</l>
<l>Each an eternity of expectation,</l>
<l>And weary <del>,</del> astonishment -- hour after hour!</l>
<l>And yet no living sound was living there,</l>
<l>Though, as I knew, one <hi rend="ul">live</hi> unmoving Thing</l>
<l>So near me stood in that bling solitude --</l>
<l>Stood waiting -- wherefore? by the inner door.</l></lg>

<lg><l>At last, all suddenly, in the air aloft,</l>
<l>O'er the Tower-roof, a wild, weird, wailful song</l>
<l>Woke flying, many-voiced, -- then sweeping off,</l>
<l>Out tow'rds the echoey hills, so passed away</l>
<l>In dying murmurs through the hollow dark.</l></lg>
</div>

<div>
<head>Song.</head>
<lg><l>In vain were our spells wrought,</l>
<l>In vain was she well taught</l>
<pb n="171" facs="A89/00000175.jpg"/>
<l>How that dread Watcher's eyes drowsy to keep;</l>
<l>In vain was the dragon-steed</l>
<l>There at the hour of need</l>
<l>Out with his double fright Blissward to leap.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Lost-lost-lost-lost!</l>
<l>In vain were our spells all of infinite cost!</l>
<l>Lost-lost-lost-lost!</l>
<l>Yon Gulf by a mortal may never be crost!</l>
<l>Never -- ah, never!</l>
<l>The doom holds for ever!</l>
<l>And to aid Her aught more</l>
<l>Is out of our sphere, and transcendeth our lore.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Lost-lost-lost-lost!</l>
<l>Come away -- come away.</l>
<l>Since only in soul yon vague <del>Gulph</del> <add>Gulf</add> may be crost,</l>
<l>See how uprolls the day!</l>
<l>Away to the mystic mid-regions of Sleep.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Lost-lost-lost-lost --</l>
<pb n="172" facs="A89/00000176.jpg"/>
<l>So passed that song: (of which <add>the</add> drift alone</l>
<l>Is here reached after in such leaden speech</l>
<l>As uncharmed mortals use:) and when its tones</l>
<l>Out tow'rds the mountains in the dark afar</l>
<l>Had wasted, I grew sensible, methought,</l>
<l>Of seasonable change; -- that now the Cell</l>
<l>Kept clarifying, till the darkness seemed</l>
<l>Marbled with grey; and then the Steed again,</l>
<l>And tripod, figured indistinctly through</l>
<l><add>The</add> thinning gloom, and gradually thence</l>
<l>Came forth in full development, by the same</l>
<l>Degrees reversed in which they'd faded there</l>
<l>Into the darkness as the night came on.</l></lg>

<lg><l>It was the Dawn: and thus it charing kept,</l>
<l>Till through the eastern port a golden rod</l>
<l>Of light fell transciently, and so bespake</l>
<l>The sunrise. Oh! it was a dessolate pass,</l>
<l>To feel, -- immured in that <del>so deadly place</del><add>relentless <del><unclear/> Tower</del> keep</add>, --</l>
<l><del>That then the sun was</del><add>How</add> on the purple hills the sun was then</l>
<l>Rejoicing in his glory. Then to know</l>
<l>My Prison roof: -- hour after hour, to think</l>
<l>That he was tracking with a strip of fire</l>
<pb n="173" facs="A89/00000177.jpg"/>
<l>His midway circle, and thence glorying down</l>
<l>Into the west. But this was my dread fate</l>
<l>while seven times day and night so came; and yet</l>
<l>I slept not! nor (to my amazement) there,</l>
<l>Through all this <del>weary woe, <unclear/></del><add>drear time, did the</add> wintry <del>pinch</del><add>tooth</add></l>
<l>Of hunger <del>shrunk</del><add>knaw within</add> my corporal life!<del><unclear/></del></l>
<l><del>Of</del><add>No</add> thirst inflamed <add>me</add>! While <del>ever</del> by <del>the</del><add>that grim</add> door</l>
<l>That seemed to shut athwart the stairway, stood</l>
<l><del>That</del><add>Which</add> strange, unmoving, dragon-footed steed,</l>
<l>As from the first, and there the tripod, placed</l>
<l>As 'twere to aid some fugitive to mount</l>
<l>At once -- and fly! Mere wonder at my doom,</l>
<l>So unimaginably wild and vague,</l>
<l>Relieved despair.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But on the seventh night -- hark!</l>
<l>What might I hear? -- a step? -- a light small step</l>
<l><del>Ascending by the stair! Swiftly it</del><add>That by the stair ascending, swiftly</add>came</l>
<l>Straight to the inner door -- then stopt. Alas!</l>
<l>The black valve opened not; and yet, the while,</l>
<l>In evidence of some bright <del>Presence, there</del><add>Influence</add></l>
<l>Standing without, a rainbow radiance through</l>
<l>Its solid breadth, in <del><unclear/></del><add>subtle</add> wave on <del><unclear/></del>wave</l>
<l>Came flushing, even as a sunset glow</l>
<pb n="174" facs="A89/00000178.jpg"/>
<l>Through some dense cloud upon the verge of heaven</l>
<l><del>Comes <unclear/></del><add>In swift rich curves wells percolating forth --</add><add>So cause it</add>, -- filling all the Cell at length</l>
<l>With rosy lights that in the darkness fumed</l>
<l>Like luminous odors; at the scent of which</l>
<l>The mystic Steed, so rigid until now,</l>
<l>Moved, and spread wide his glimmering wings. When, hark!</l>
<l>Another step? Yea, the same strenuous tramp</l>
<l>That once before I'd heard big-beating up,</l>
<l>Came following -- till a low sad cry without</l>
<l>Went to my heart, and I might hear ensue</l>
<l>A struggle as of one forced down the stair</l>
<l>By that so ruthless Guard! -- down, till the Cell</l>
<l>Again had darkened, and the Tower itself</l>
<l>Stood once more as in some mute void of Time,</l>
<l>Or depth of distance infinitely out,</l>
<l>Achingly still. But not for long! again</l>
<l>The Monster's hateful tread came booming up,</l>
<l>Quake <del><unclear/></del><add>above</add> quake that with a shudder stopt</l>
<l>Dead at the door! It opened; and he stood</l>
<l>Full in the dubious space: -- but ere the Fiend</l>
<l>Might enter farther, rage and hate at once</l>
<l>Possessed me, and I charged him! For awhile</l>
<l>His horrible glooms voluminously vague,</l>
<l>Yet with a smothering pressure in their folds,</l>
<pb n="175" facs="A89/00000179.jpg"/>
<l>Involved me, -- concentrating more and more,</l>
<l>And lapping closer in yet denser coils,</l>
<l>Each moment! -- but my loathing now had grown</l>
<l>Into so vast a horror, that, methought,</l>
<l>I burst with irresistible strength away!</l>
<l>Rushed through the door, and down the stairway, -- down</l>
<l>An endless depth; till a <unclear/>, hinged</l>
<l>In the Tower's basement, opened to my flight!</l>
<l>No sooner had I passed it than it fell</l>
<l>In thunder to! and thence my passage lay</l>
<l>Along the difficult ledges of a rock</l>
<l>Bordering the Lake. --</l></lg>

<lg><l>And when at last I paused</l>
<l>In that so giddy flight, methought I saw</l>
<l>The lustrous Lady up through the lit air</l>
<l>Ascending, with a steadfast downward look</l>
<l>Of parting recognition, -- full of love,</l>
<l>But painless, passionless. Uh
