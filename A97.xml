<head>Part I.</head>

<lg><l>A lonely Boy, for venturing from his home,</l>
<l>Out on the half-wild herd's dim tracks I roam:</l>
<l>A lonely Truant, numbering years eleven,</l>
<l>'Mid rock-browed mountains <del><unclear></unclear></del> <add>heaping</add> up to heaven!</l>
<l>Here huge-piled ledges, ribbing outward, stare</l>
<l>Down into haggard chasms; onward, there,</l>
<l>The vast backed ridges are all rent in jags,</l>
<l>Or hunched with cones, or pinnacled with crags.</l>
<l>A rude peculiar world, the prospect lies</l>
<l>Bounded in circuit by the bending skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Now at some stone tank scooped out by the shocks</l>
<l>Of rain-floods plunging from the upper rocks,</l>
<l>Whose liquid disc, in its undimpled rest,</l>
<l>Glows like a mighty gem, brooching the mountain's breast,</l>
<l>I drink, and muse, - or mark the wide spread <del><unclear></unclear></del> herd,</l>
<l>Or list the tinkling of the dingle-bird;</l>
<l>And now tow'rds some wild-hanging shade I stray,</l>
<l>To shun the bright oppression of the day:</l>
<l>For round each crag, and o'er each bosky swell,</l>
<l>The fierce refracted heat of flares visible -</l>
<l>Lambently restless, like the dazzling hew</l>
<l>Of some else-viewless veil held trembling over them.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">A change is felt - a change that yet reveals</l>
<l>A something only that mere instinct feels,</l>
<l>Why congregate the swallows in the air,</l>

<pb n="4" facs="A97/00000005.jpg"/>

<l><add>25.</add></l>
<l>And northward then in rapid flight repair?</l>
<l>At once insettled, and all roaming slow</l>
<l>With heads declined, why do the oxen low?</l>
<l>With sudden swelling dim, the remote, yet harsh,</l>
<l>Why roar the bull-frogs in the tea-tree marsh?</l>
<l>Why cease the locusts <ref target="A97-00000005">*</ref> to <del><unclear></unclear></del> throng up in flight,</l>
<l>And clap their gay wings in the fervent light?</l>
<l>Why climb they, bodingly demure, instead,</l>
<l>The tallest spear-grass to the bending head?</l>
<l>Instinctively along the sultry sky,</l>
<l>I turn a listless, yet enquiring eye;</l>
<l>And mark that now, with a most gradual pace,</l>
<l>A solemn trance creams gradual o'er its face;</l>
<l>Slow, but inevitable - wide about</l>
<l>On all hands from the South effusing out:</l>
<l>Yon clouds that late were laboring past the sun,</l>
<l>Reached by its sure arrest, one after one,</l>
</lg>

<note xml:id="A97-00000005"><p>What in this country we call the <hi rend="ul">grasshopper</hi> is no doubt <lb/>the "locust" of the Bible - the locust that John the Baptist made <lb/>his dinner of in the wilderness. The Blacks often eat them as a <lb/>food; and even the native dog not only affects them as a dainty, <lb/>but seems to thrive upon them. In the right season, and in <lb/>places where they happen to be plentiful, he may sometimes be <lb/>seem jumping after them as they fly up before <del>them</del> him, for several <lb/>hours at a stretch. On the other hand, what we Australians call <lb/><hi rend="ul">locusts</hi> of all kinds, are but various species of the <hi rend="ul">cicada</hi>. And <lb/>while on this note, I may as well mention, that just before a storm, <lb/>the locusts or grasshoppers <unclear>inhabiling</unclear> such flats and basins <lb/>as are liable to be suddenly flooded by <add>it</add>, will all be seen instinctively <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> mounting to the tassals of the reeds and higher grases, - <lb/>exactly as described in the text, - so as to be as high and dry as <lb/>possible in the event of a local deluge. Verily, what we call <lb/><hi rend="ul">instinct</hi>, is a thing altogether wonderful.</p></note>

<l>Come to a heavy halt; as travellers see</l>
<l>In the wide wilderness of Araby,</l>
<l>Some pilgrim horse at even, band by band,</l>
<l>Halting amid the grey <add>&amp; <unclear></unclear></add> interminable sand.</l>
<l>Thence down descending, its dull slumbrous weight</l>
<l>Sullenly settles on the mountain's great</l>
<l>Upheaving heads, until the airs the played</l>
<l>About their rugged temples - all are laid:</l>
<l>While drawing nearer far off heights appear,</l>
<l>As in a dream's wild prospect - strangely near!</l>
<l>Till into wood resolves their robe of blue,</l>
<l>And the <del>bluff</del> <add>grey</add> crags come bluffly into view.</l>
<l>- Such are the signs and tokens that presage</l>
<l>A Summer Hurricane's forthcoming rage.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">At length <add>the</add> South sends out her cloudy heaps,</l>
<l>And up the glens a dusky dimness creeps.</l>
<l>The birds, late warbling in the hanging green</l>
<l>Of steep-set brakes, <del>a <unclear></unclear> effected</del> <add>seek now some safer</add> screen, -</l>
<l>Skimming in silence o'er the ominous scene.</l>
<l>The herd in doubt no longer wanders wide,</l>
<l>But, fast ingathering, throngs yon mountain's side,</l>
<l>Whose echoes, surging to its tramp, might seem</l>
<l>The muttered troubles of some Titan's dream.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Fast the dim legions of the mustering Storm</l>
<l>Throng denser, or protruding columns form;</l>
<l>While splashing forward from their cloudy lair,</l>
<l>Convolving flames, like scouting dragons, glare:</l>
<l>Low thunders follow, laboring up the sky;</l>
<l>And as forerunning blasts go blaring by,</l>
<l>At once the Forest, with a might stir,</l>
<l>Bows, as in homage to the Thunderer!</l>

<l>Strange hissing whispers seem to huddle past;</l>
<l>As if the dread stir had aroused from sleep</l>
<l>Weird Spirits, cloistered in yon cavy steep,</l>
<l>(On which, on the grim Past, some Cain's offence</l>

<l>How sails yon Eagle like a black flag spread</l>
<l>Before it - coming! On his wide wings weighed,</l>
<l>Hardly he seems to move, from hence surveyed;</l>
<l>When, far aloft, a bulging mass of gloom</l>
<l>That bends out o'er him, bloating as with doom,</l>
<l>Grows frightfully luminous! Short stops his flight!</l>
<l>His dark form shrivels in the blasting light!</l>
<l>And then as follows a sharp thundrous sound,</l>
<l>Falls whizzing, stone-like, lifeless to the ground!</l>

<lg><l>Now like a shudder at great Nature's heart</l>
<l>The turmoil grows. Now Wonder, with a start,</l>
<l>Marks where, right overhead, wild Thor careers,</l>
<l>Girt with black Horrors and wide-flaming Fears!</l>
<l>Arriving thunders, mustering on his path,</l>
<l>Swell more and more the roarings of his wrath,</l>
<l>As out in widening circles they extend -</l>
<l>And then - at once - in utter silence end.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Portentous silence! Time keeps breathing past -</l>
<l>Yet it continues! May this marvel last?</l>
<l>This wild weird silence in the midst of gloom</l>
<l>So manifestly big with latent doom?</l>
<l>Tingles the boding ear; and <del><unclear></unclear></del> <add>up</add> the glens</l>
<l>Instinctive dread comes howling from the wild-dogs' dens.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Terrific Vision! Heaven's great circling splits,</l>
<l>And a vast globe of writhing fire emits,</l>
<l>Which, flanking out in one continuous stream,</l>
<l>Spans the black concave like burning beam,</l>
<l>A moment; - then, from end to end, it shakes</l>
<l>With a quick motion - and in thunder breaks!</l>
<l>Peal rolled on peal! while heralding the sound,</l>
<l>As each concussion thrills the solid ground,</l>
<l>Fierce glares coil snake-like round the rocky wens</l>
<l>Of the <hi rend="ul">red</hi> hills, or hiss into the glens;</l>
<l>Or thick through heaven like flaming falshions swarm,</l>
<l>Cleaving the teeming cisterns of the Storm,</l>
<l>From which rain-torrents, (searching every gash)</l>
<l>Split by the blast, come sheeting, with a dash</l>
<l>Most multitudinous - down through the trees,</l>
<l>And 'gainst the smoking crags that <unclear>beette</unclear> over these!</l>

<l rend="indent">On yon grey Peak, with rock-encrusted roots,</l>
<l>The seeming Patriarch of the Wood upshoots,</l>
<l>In whose proud-spreading top's imperial height,</l>
<l>The mountain Eagle loveth <del>oft <unclear></unclear></del> <add>most</add> to 'light:</l>
<l>Now dimly seen through the tempestuous air,</l>
<l>His form seem harrowed by a mad despair,</l>
<l>As with his ponderous arms uplifted high,</l>
<l>He wrestles with the Storm and threshes at the sky!</l>
<l>But not for long. Up in the lurid air,</l>
<l>A swift red bolt is heard to hurtle there -</l>
<l>A dread crash follows - and the Peak is bare!</l>
<l>Huge fragments, hurrying from its shattered cone,</l>
<l>Wide in the murky air are seen alone -</l>
<l>Huge shapeless fragments round about it cast,</l>
<l>Like crude-wing'd, mad-limbed Monsters squandering in the blast!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The duskness thickens! With despairing cry</l>
<l>From shattering boughs the rain-drenched parrots fly!</l>
<l>Loose rocks wash rumbling from the mountains round,</l>
<l>And half the forest strews the smoking ground!</l>
<l>Stemm'd by the wet crags the blasts wilder moan,</l>
<l>And the caves labor with a ghostlier groan!</l>
<l>Resistless torrents down the gorges flow</l>
<l>With knasshing clamours harshening as they go;</l>
<l>And where from craggy bluffs their volumes leap,</l>
<l>Bear with them - down, in many a whirling heap,</l>
<l>Those sylvan wrecks that littered late the path</l>
<l>Of the loud Hurricane's all-trampling wrath;</l>
<l>While to their dread percussions, inward sent,</l>
<l>The hearts of the great hills beat with astonishment!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Strange darings seize me, witnessing this strife</l>
<l>Of Nature; while, as heedless of my life,</l>
<l>I stand exposed. And does some destined charm</l>

<l><add>30.</add></l>
<l>Hold me secure from elemental harm,</l>
<l>That in the mighty riot I may find</l>
<l>How through all being works the light of Mind?</l>
<l>Yea, through the strikingly external see</l>
<l>My novel Soul's divulging energy!</l>
<l>Spirit transmuting into forms of thought</l>
<l>What but for its cognition were <hi rend="ul">as nought</hi>!</l>
<l>Soul wildly drawn abroad - a Protean force</l>
<l>Clothing with higher life the Tempest in its course.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>The Storm is past. Yet booming on afar</l>
<l>Is heard the rattling of Thor's thunder-car,</l>
<l>And that low muffled moaning, as if grief,</l>
<l>Which follows, with a wood-sigh wide and brief.</l>
<l>The clouds break up. The sun's forth bursting rays</l>
<l>Clothe the wet landscape with a spangling blaze.</l>
<l>The birds begin to sing a lively strain,</l>
<l>And merry echoes ring it o'er again.</l>
<l>The clustered <del>hea</del> herd is spreading out to graze,</l>
<l>Though lessening torrents still a hundred ways</l>
<l>Flash downward, and from many a tanky ledge</l>
<l>A mantling gush comes quick and shining o'er the edge.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>'Tis evening; and the torrents furious flow</l>
<l>Hath now subsided in the laks below.</l>
<l>O'er all the freshened scene no sound is heard,</l>
<l>Save the short twitter of some busied bird,</l>
<l>Or a faint rustle caused amongst the trees</l>
<l>By wasting fragments of a broken breeze.</l>
<l>Round with a heightened buoyancy I stroll,</l>
<l>And a new happiness o'erflows my soul,</l>
<l>As from some cause beyond the reach of thought,</l>

<pb n="10" facs="A97/00000011.jpg"/>

<l><add>31.</add></l>
<l>And which this notion has within me wrought</l>
<l>Through instinct only, that the Storm to day,</l>
<l>Hath haply purged some pestilence away,</l>
<l>Whose sultry venom in all nature's ways</l>
<l>Would else have lurked for many doomful days:</l>
<l>And hence, even 'mid the sylvan carnage spread</l>
<l>O'er every turn in the wild paths I tread,</l>
<l>Full many a flowery nook and sunny brow</l>
<l>Presents some pleasantness unmarked till now.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Thus, when the element of social life</l>
<l>Burst with a soul-quake into mortal strife,</l>
<l>Some prophet feeling, we know not from whence,</l>

<div type="poem">
<head>Part I.</head>

<lg><l>'Twas night - and where a watery sound</l>
<l rend="indent">Came moaning up the Flat,</l>
<l>Six rude and bearded Stockmen round</l>
<l rend="indent">Their blazing hut-fire sat:</l>
<l>Laughing, as on some starting hound</l>
<l rend="indent">The cracking fuel spat.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>And merrier still the log-fire cracks</l>
<l rend="indent">As night the darker falls,</l>
<l>While not a noisy tongue their lacks</l>
<l rend="indent">To tell of drunken brawls:</l>
<l>But most of battle with the Blacks</l>
<l rend="indent">Some bloody tale appals.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>One tells how, after a fierce fray,</l>
<l rend="indent">A wounded Chief he found</l>
<l>Dark-lying, log-like, on his way,</l>
<l rend="indent">Sore gashed with many a wound,</l>
<l>And how, as there alive he lay,</l>
<l rend="indent">He staked him to the ground.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Or how, in the elbow of a creek</l>
<l rend="indent">That ran 'neath crag-walls grey,</l>
<l>A tribe entire, with many a shriek,</l>
<l rend="indent">Was pout, and held at bay,</l>
<l><del><unclear></unclear></del> Till there, like sheep, in one close heap,</l>
<l rend="indent">Their slaughtered bodies lay.</l>

<l><add>33.</add></l>
<l>Amongst them then Ned Connor spoke,</l>
<l rend="indent">And up his form he drew:</l>
<l>What is there in an open stroke</l>
<l rend="indent">To boast of? Ye but slew</l>
<l>Those who'd have done, each hell-black one,</l>
<l rend="indent">The or worse to you.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>But lost amongst the hills one day,</l>
<l rend="indent">Which then was well-nigh shut,</l>
<l>I met a Black upon my way</l>
<l rend="indent">And thus the matter put</l>
<l>Unto him - See! this knife's for thee -</l>
<l rend="indent">Come guide me to my Hut.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>His savage eyes grew huge with joy</l>
<l rend="indent">As on the prize they bent,</l>
<l>Then leading, even like a boy,</l>
<l rend="indent">He capered as he went:</l>
<l>But think you, men, to give the toy</l>
<l rend="indent">Ned Connor ever meant?</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>An hour had brought us many a mile,</l>
<l rend="indent">And then, as closed the day,</l>
<l>The Savage pointed with a smile</l>
<l rend="indent">To where my Station lay:</l>
<l>There! give to me the <hi rend="ul">knife</hi>, said he,</l>
<l rend="indent">And let me go my way.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>'Tis long since, but how well even yet</l>
<l rend="indent">My memory can retrace</l>
<l>His features; for the sun was set,</l>
<l rend="indent">And through an<del>d</del> open space,</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">The long red gleams of its last beams</hi></l>
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="ul">Fell full upon his face.</hi></l>
</lg>

<pb n="13" facs="A97/00000014.jpg"/>

<lg><l><add>34.</add></l>
<l>But I ne'er meant that he should touch</l>
<l rend="indent">The knife as I have said,</l>
<l>And when he stretched his hand to clutch,</l>
<l rend="indent">A thought came in my head:</l>
<l>I raised my gun, as if in fun -</l>
<l rend="indent">I fired! - and he was <hi rend="ul">dead</hi>!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Dead as a door-nail! There he lay</l>
<l rend="indent">In the forest, that duskier grew</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">While out in the blood-red West away</hi></l>
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="ul">My Hut loomed full in view</hi>: -</l>
<l>But what, my boys, keeps down your noise -</l>
<l rend="indent">Do ye think I <hi rend="ul">ate</hi> him too?</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>The ruffian laughed in a ruthless mood</l>
<l rend="indent">When ended had thus his tale;</l>
<l>But all the rest, though men of blood,</l>
<l rend="indent">With horror seemed to quail,</l>
<l>And saw, though he stood boastfully,</l>
<l rend="indent">That Connor too was pale.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>For through the moaning of the trees</l>
<l rend="indent">He seemed to hear the sound</l>
<l>Of his own laughter in the breeze</l>
<l rend="indent">Keep roaming out - till drowned</l>
<l>In wild and bitter mockeries</l>
<l rend="indent">Up answering from the ground.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Now what to hear had made them fear</l>
<l rend="indent">Had also made them dry:</l>
<l>But strange! the water-pail that late</l>

<l>The pail has leaked! cried one: and yet</l>
<l rend="indent">The ground is dry below!</l>
<l>What next, I wonder? Here 'twas set</l>
<l rend="indent">Fresh filled an hour ago -</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">Here</hi>, where it stands, by these my hands:</l>
<l rend="indent">The Devil drinks deep, I trow!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>It cowed them! this so strange affair,</l>
<l rend="indent">However it came about:</l>
<l>'Tis surely empty, and yet where</l>
<l rend="indent">Hath <del>any</del> ever a drop leaked out?</l>
<l>Another said, and shook his head:</l>
<l rend="indent">There's something up I doubt!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>It cowed them! Though they were indeed</l>
<l rend="indent">A bold and reckless crew,</l>
<l>While each saw in his Mate's pale heed</l>
<l rend="indent">His own; yet since they knew</l>
<l>The utmost measure of their need</l>
<l rend="indent">The thirstier they grew.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>At last in bitterness they said</l>
<l rend="indent">Come this will never do!</l>
<l>'Tis your next turn for water, Ned,</l>
<l rend="indent">Then why not go? He drew</l>
<l>Full hard his breath, and from his head</l>
<l rend="indent">There dripped a sudden dew.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>But shaming to be taxed with fear,</l>
<l rend="indent">He seized the pail, and said,</l>
<l>What care I though the night be drear -</l>
<l rend="indent">Who ever<del><unclear></unclear></del> saw the <hi rend="ul">dead</hi>?</l>
<l>And if I fail to fill this pail,</l>

<l>Thus on the ominous word that he</l>
<l rend="indent">Who drew it last had said,</l>
<l>He played in scorn - but bitterly,</l>
<l rend="indent">Because of a haggard dread</l>
<l>That shivered within his heart of sin,</l>

<l rend="indent">He'll bring with him the day!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>But while they thus were wondering - hark!</l>
<l rend="indent">They heard a frantic shriek;</l>

<l rend="indent">The day was breaking bright;</l>
<l>But shuddering as in mental pain,</l>
<l rend="indent">He turned from the happy light,</l>
<l>And pointing said, I would to bed,</l>

</lg>

<lg><l>They bore him to his bed straightway,</l>
<l rend="indent">Those horror-striken men,</l>

<l rend="indent">Of what had met his ken:</l>

<lg><l>I went (you heard) with impious boast</l>
<l rend="indent">For water to the brook;</l>
<l>But when the threshold I had crossed</l>
<l rend="indent">All strength my heart forsook:</l>
<l>I rued each forward step - but most</l>
<l rend="indent">I feared behind to look.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Long murky clouds were hurrying fast</l>
<l rend="indent">Across the moonless sky;</l>
<l>Strange sounds came moaning up the blast</l>
<l rend="indent">That whistled by fits so high:</l>

<l rend="indent">Went wildly moaning by.</l>
</lg>

<l>The same as when <del>I shed</del> his blood I shed,</l>

<l><hi rend="indent">That day's red sunset - red as blood,</hi></l>

<l rend="indent">Arise from the clammy plain,</l>
<l>While thence an earthy odor broke</l>
<l rend="indent">That stung into my brain.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>At first I saw it bloating out,</l>
<l rend="indent">In size not o'er a span:</l>
<l>Then as it slowly coiled about</l>
<l rend="indent">To heighten it began,</l>
<l>Until it took in bulk and look</l>
<l rend="indent">The Likeness of a man.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>The Likeness of a man, I say,</l>
<l rend="indent">As visioned to the mind,</l>
<l>But to the eye an Image grey,</l>
<l rend="indent">To shapeless change inclined,</l>
<l>Like columned mist at break of day</l>
<l rend="indent">When reached by the rising wind.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Yet was it dreadful to the eye,</l>
<l rend="indent">Though more so to the thought,</l>
<l>When standing vaguely up, man-high,</l>
<l rend="indent">And gathered as from nought,</l>
<l>It had through change so weird and strange</l>
<l rend="indent">To a human mockery wrought.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>No stir was near: I might but hear</l>
<l rend="indent">The beating of my blood!</l>
<l>And there, within my reach almost</l>
<l rend="indent">The horrid Phantom stood!</l>

<l rend="indent">Decayedly of the earth!</l>

<lg><l>Then suddenly it wheeled, and went</l>
<l rend="indent">Right round me - round and round;</l>
<l>Till, in its hellish sport, it bent</l>
<l rend="indent">And at me seemed to bound!</l>
<l>A bound - a rush: then came a crush</l>
<l rend="indent">That beat me to the ground!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Mine eyes splashed out with sputtering flame -</l>
<l rend="indent">The ground kept swimming fast -</l>

<l>A moment more - and all was o'er,</l>
<l rend="indent">As I had breathed my last.</l>

<head>The Honey Bird.</head>

<p>[The native bird thus called, or more commonly, the Honey-sucker, is quite a curiosity <lb/>in natural history. Its bill is a mere tube, <del>almost</del> <add>about</add> as large in girth as a darning needle, <lb/>and nearly as long. It is in fact nearly <del>as long as</del> equal in length to all the rest <lb/>of the bird's body, the tail (as in the case of all fowls with very long bills) being <lb/>short and stumpy, like that of the kingfisher. In this tube there is a sort of <lb/>natural pump-sucker, and the bird is thus enabled to come at the honey <lb/>which is contained in the deep cups of the mountain bugle and bell flowers. <lb/>Hence the habitat of the Honey Bird is always to be found in those localities <lb/>(invariably mountainous) which give birth in profusion to flowers of the <lb/>kinds above mentioned, and of other kinds akin to them. In such places only <lb/>grow these deep-cupped flowers, and in such places only is there a tube- <lb/>-billed bee-bird to batten upon their sweetness: so curiously adaptative in <lb/>her principles is our wonderful Mother, - Nature.</p>

<p>And here no doubt the question will occur to some one: But having <pb n="27" facs="A97/00000028.jpg"/> equipt this bird in a manner so peculiar, how does Nature manage to preserve its being <lb/>during the winter season, when there are no flowers? In answer to this I have <lb/>only a guess to offer - namely, that perhaps it becomes and lies dormant in <lb/>cold frost weather, for it certainly has not sufficient strength of wing for <lb/>emigration to any such distance as would reach to a climate difference <lb/>of temperature.</p>

<p>It should be added, that though the bill of the Honey Bird is a mere tube, <lb/>it is not therefore wholly dumb, but contrives to <hi rend="ul">blow through it</hi>, as it <lb/>hops about amongst the flowers, a somewhat slender yet agreeable note.]</p>

<lg><l>Wherever in some mountain bower</l>

<l>O'er fed into satiety.</l>

<lg><l>And so, wherever Loveliness</l>
<l>Dwells secluded - dwells to bless,</l>

<l>O'er all that round them nearest lay</l>
<l>In tribe-like groups - broad Warren <hi rend="ul">there</hi>,</l>
<l>And Yango, in the upper air</l>

<l>The day was well-nigh ended,</l>

<l>Wide winding, - a huge gap between</l>
<l>Two craggy walls that showed the trace</l>

<l>Wide winding, like a time-hewn path</l>

<l rend="indent">And wondrous was the backward view</l>
<l>Thence seen from where the gorge came through.</l>
<l>Huddled together, and high <del><unclear></unclear></del> up-piled,</l>
<l>All was there that's rudely wild</l>
<l>In alpine form and liniament,</l>
<l>All mingled, and yet all unblent:</l>
<l>Nature's most enormous freaks,</l>
<l>Hunching cones and snouted peaks</l>
<l>Ruggeder than e'er were dreamed;</l>
<l>And rushing up till the sky was rent</l>

<l>Far my <del><unclear></unclear></del> feet had fared not, when</l>

<l>Deep carved in the bark of a grand old Tree</l>
<l>A fatal-fortuned Name.</l>

<l>And savager haunts of the forest lay,</l>
<l>And the wild prospect, mist-enskied,</l>
<l>Dropt, as it were, into some grey</l>
<l>Abysm in the Far Away.</l>
<l>Wherefore I turned me from the road</l>
<l>WIth a sympathetic load</l>
<l>At heart, and with a rueful face,</l>

<l rend="indent">That evening! never knew I one</l>
<l>More solemn. The great round red sun</l>
<l>O'er the lit summits crowded vast</l>
<l>Against the west, was sinking fast.</l>
<l>A few grey cloud-shreds only were</l>
<l>Seen in the vault of heaven to stir,</l>
<l>As cobwebs, dim and torn, might wave</l>
<l>From the marble dome of a mighty cave.</l>
<l>A gust, at  <del>measured</del> <add>fitful</add> intervals</l>
<l>Fell over the nearer mountain walls,</l>

<l>Rustled away through the rounding brakes,</l>
<l>Or lingered, as it were to pine</l>
<l>In the twilight top of the turpentine</l>
<l>Its own low dirge - a dying tone</l>
<l>In the turpentine's dense top alone.</l>
<l>And once a dusky Eagle came</l>
<l>In solemn travel o'er the same -</l>
<l>Steadily straight, as from afar</l>
<l>Came over, - but the airy jar</l>
<l>Of his huge wings in swift decrease,</l>
<l>Soon faded, as with upward sweep</l>
<l>They passed beyond the opponent steep,</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">And now the sought for Grave I found. -</l>
<l>Against me stretched, its lonely mound</l>
<l>Was darkly seen, and by degrees,</l>
<l>In the broken shade of the silent trees:</l>

<l>From the setting sun, for a moment played</l>

<l>Timidly up, as near I trod,</l>

<l>O 'twas a desolate, dreary thing,</l>
<l>That Grave in the else-green lap of Spring -</l>

<l>As I looked on it then through a starting tear,</l>

<l>In a Grave like that first in the world - O God!</l>
<l>That first bleak <del><unclear></unclear></del> scar in the Earth's new mould</l>
<l>Which stretched over Abel in Eden of old,</l>

<l>His Image on that evil day,</l>
<l>As first he came within the view</l>
<l>Of felons bent to slay.</l>
<l>A visionary Youth, methought,</l>
<l>On he came, all wonder-wrought</l>
<l>With the dreary grandeur <del><unclear></unclear></del> massed</l>
<l>Aloft in shapes so wild and vast,</l>
<l>And which his memory oft compared</l>
<l>For contrast, with the rural joy</l>
<l>Of scenes in England where he'd fared</l>
<l>The oftenest when a happy Boy -</l>
<l>Some gated lane, some village glen,</l>
<l>That rang with Love's home voices then:</l>
<l>And not like those which <hi rend="ul">there</hi> he saw,</l>
<l>All silent<del><unclear></unclear></del>, or but fitfully</l>
<l>Bestartled, when close-flying by</l>
<l>Some seldom-sighted loud macaw</l>
<l>Might send abroad his doleful cry:</l>
<l>A sound that waileth through the air</l>
<l>Like an utterance of Despair,</l>
<l>Or of Sorrow mourning high,</l>
<l>As she is wont in lonesome places,</l>
<l>Where but her own wild shade she chases,</l>

<l>The navy-laden waves that roar</l>
<l>Along the Anglic coast, to seek</l>

<l>They'd seen again, as inter-ruin,</l>
<l>Their own young beings' bloom.</l>

<l>Where, too, a kindred creature's tread</l>
<l>Comes but to wake a haggard cry</l>
<l>Of wonder in the wild-dog's lair,</l>
<l>The living's sole abode; and where</l>
<l>The Black, even, seldom ventures nigh,</l>
<l>Nor dares to halt: but striding fast,</l>

<l>What suddenly hushes their thoughtless noise -</l>
<l>The Whiteman's Grave! then hurries past!</l>
</lg>

<l>I lay down by the Grave, and wept!</l>
<l>Yea, wept as we ate fain to weep</l>
<l>When some great load is on the brain,</l>
<l>As given by Nature so to keep</l>
<l>The saddest thinking sane;</l>
<l>And sweet for future use, I trow,</l>
<l>When we shall understand at length</l>
<l>What beauty of soul, and grace to know,</l>
<l>And wisely sympathetic strength</l>
<l>Were born to us of Woe:</l>
<l>Wept, until clouding up the Glen</l>
<l>The dark came, following the grey</l>

<l>Were quenching in the West, with freshened powers</l>
<l rend="indent">The field again in honorable toil</l>

<l rend="indent">Till the dressed orchard or the well-turned soil</l>
<l rend="indent">Showed a good day's work done.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Then while the unharnessed steers I woodward took,</l>
<l>Or sought the kine, that in some grassy nook</l>
<l rend="indent"><del>Where</del> <add>Were</add> ruminating all in full-fed ease,</l>
<l>The sun should 'light upon his western hill,</l>
<l rend="indent">Slanting his last beams through the shadowing trees,</l>

<l>Into such symbols as might best impart</l>

<lg><l>How wonderful are Dreams! Yet, are they but</l>
<l>(As some suppose) the thin disjoining shades</l>
<l>Of facts or feelings long foregone or late,</l>
<l>As recomposed and put in ghostly act,</l>
<l>And strange procession, wildly mixed, and yet</l>
<l>So life-like, though thus composite and wild,</l>
<l>By mimic Fancy; when, alone awake,</l>
<l>And thence unhindered in her mystic craft,</l>
<l>She tracks again the drifts of wearied Thought,</l>
<l>Itself sunk sleepward! Wonderful no less</l>
<l>Are they though this be true; and wondrous more</l>
<l>Is she who in the dark, and stript of sense,</l>
<l>Can claim such sovereignty - the Queen of Art!</l>
<l>For what a cunning painter is she then,</l>
<l>Who hurriedly embodying from the waste</l>
<l>Of things memorial littering life's dim floor,</l>
<l>The forms and features, manifold and quaint,</l>
<l>That crowd the timeless vistas of a Dream,</l>
<l>Fails never in a stroke; and breathes as well</l>
<l>(With powers that laugh at Sculpture, - or make good</l>
<l>The fabled influence of Pygmalion's weird</l>
<l>Devotion to his own creative craft)</l>
<l>A spirit to motion into all her work -</l>
<l>The test of Deity; - inspiring too</l>
<l>Her phantom creatures with more eloquent tones</l>
<l>Than ever broke in subtle light-like waves</l>
<l>Upon the province of a waking ear.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">But are they more? Sure glimpses oft, though vague,</l>
<l>Derived from some unnavigable <add>S</add>ea</l>
<l>Of mystic being, on whose lonely shore</l>
<l>The normal terminates; and where the pent,</l>
<l>Impatient Soul, from its sleep-shrouded crib,</l>
<l>Is sometimes wont to slip, and roam at large,</l>
<l>Like Crusoe, staring forth; or musing stand</l>
<l>As did the intelligence of Newton once</l>
<l>On the bare beach of <add>T</add>ime, while the great deep</l>
<l>Of Truth, by Science yet uncharted, loomed</l>
<l>In shoreless width, - illimitably out,</l>
<l>Under the incommunicable sky?</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">No answer cometh, and as vain is all</l>
<l>Conjecture: they are <add>D</add>reams! but wonderful,</l>
<l>However we may rank them in our lore.</l>
<l>And worthy of some fond record are those states</l>

<l>Or witching Memory, where she darkling lies,</l>
<l>Can so accomplish her that she can make</l>
<l>All brute bulk ocular - the great Earth itself</l>
<l>Diaphanous, like a mighty globe of glass</l>
<l>Hung in the dim Inane, and thence reveal</l>
<l>Some yearned-for hearth at the antipodes,</l>
<l>With all its loves; or spread at once her wings</l>
<l>O'er all the eras of a wandering life,</l>
<l>As from the orient to the ends of heaven</l>

<l>All things beneath them in one world-wide act,</l>
<l>Instant and universal. - Wonderful!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">But not thus always are our dreams benign:</l>
<l>Oft are they miscreations - gloomier worlds,</l>
<l>Crowded tempestuously with Wrongs and Fears,</l>
<l>More ghastly than the Actual ever knew;</l>
<l>And rent with racking noises - such as might,</l>
<l>If audible ever to a soul awake,</l>
<l>Go thundering only through the wastes of Hell.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">So wonderful are Dreams: and I have known</l>
<l>Many most wild and strange. And once, long since,</l>
<l>As in the death-like mystery of Sleep</l>
<l>My body lay impalled, my soul arose</l>
<l>And journeyed outward in <add n="1">D</add>ream of <add n="2">W</add>onder,</l>
<l>In the mid hour of a dark night, methought</l>
<l>I roamed the margin of a waveless <add>L</add>ake,</l>
<l>That, in the knotted forehead of the land</l>
<l>Deep sunken, like a huge Cyclopean eye,</l>
<l>Lidless and void of speculation, stared</l>
<l>Glassily up, - forever sleepless, - up</l>
<l>At the wide vault of heaven; and that I had</l>
<l>Also a vague and mystic consciousness</l>
<l>That over against me, on the farther shore,</l>
<l>Which yet I might not see, there stood a Tower</l>
<l>Such as we read of in some old romance.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The darkness darkened, until overhead</l>
<l>Solidly black the starless heaven domed,</l>
<l>And earth was one wide blot; - when, as I looked,</l>
<l>A light swung blazing from the tower (as yet</l>
<l>Prophesied only in imagination,)</l>
<l>And brought at once its rounded structure forth</l>
<l>Out of the mighty gloom, wherein <unclear></unclear> then</l>
<l><add>So shut was its tall presence, that it seemed</add></l>
<l><add>As therewith one in visual consistence.</add></l>
<l>And when this light had steadied, hanging there</l>
<l>Suspended as by magic, I might see</l>
<l>In the wide lake, whose whole disc now first shown,</l>
<l>Glimmered enormous, - the far falling stream</l>
<l>Of its wild radiance, columnar and vast,</l>
<l>Reach quivering - down, like a great shaft of fire,</l>
<l>Through the lit fluid, that, so lightened, seemed</l>
<l>A vague abysm infinitely deep.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Long at that wild light was I gazing held</l>
<l>In speechless wonder - till I thence could feel</l>
<l>A strange and thrillingly attractive power</l>
<l>In gradual operation; and ere long</l>
<l>My bodily weight seemed witched away, and up</l>
<l>I mounted, poised within the passive air;</l>
<l>Then glode ascendingly sheer o'er the lake,</l>
<l>Which far below, as tow'rds the wondrous light</l>

<l>The attraction drew me, and I beheld illumined</l>
<l>Even to its sullen depths with shifting beams,</l>
<l>That tangled <add>T</add>ower-ward into one broad path</l>
<l>Of multifarious splendour - <hi rend="it">one</hi> red blaze</l>
<l>Yet various, interwrithing, wild and quick,</l>
<l>As every molecule of the watery mass</l>
<l>Had an organic life, and played a part</l>
<l>Restlessly proper to its wayward self,</l>
<l>Though tending all into one glow of bright</l>
<l>Disunion in bright union - <hi rend="it">one</hi> red blaze.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Still poised within the soft air, on I slid:</l>
<l>Nor knew I why - but my amaze wore off</l>
<l>As thus I glode over the lake, and still</l>
<l>Approached the <add>T</add>ower, and that so wondrous light!</l>
<l>And soon, instead, a many-branching warmth</l>
<l>Like the sweet inklings of new love, <add>began</add></l>
<l><del>Began</del> <add>T</add>o tingle in my blood, and so divine</l>
<l>The nearness of some yet unseen Content,</l>
<l>Still nearing, or some yet inaudible Joy,</l>
<l>So great, so reconciling, that it seemed</l>
<l>It was a golden destiny whose spell</l>
<l>Had lifted me aloft, and <add>T</add>ower-ward on</l>
<l>Thus richly attracted: - and with this so sweet</l>

<l>Of light immaculate! Yea, face and form</l>
<l>All of a Hesper radiancy composed,</l>
<l>And lovelier than lustrous, stood alone,</l>
<l>Yet, as it seemed, expectant; for as still</l>
<l>She witched me tow'rds her, she kept beckoning still</l>
<l>With tiny hand more splendid than a star:</l>
<l>Beckoning and smiling - not as mortals smile,</l>
<l>With visible throes, to the mere face confined,</l>
<l>But with her whole bright influence all at once</l>
<l>In gracious act - as the <add>I</add>mmortals smile,</l>

<l>A golden prevalence of power abroad,</l>

<l><add>Into the glory of its own delight -</add></l>
<l><add>Transfiguring both! And with a voice intense</add></l>
<l>And intimately tender as the first</l>
<l>Fine feeling of a love-born bliss - and oh!</l>
<l>More silvery in its sweetness to the soul's</l>
<l>Ornacular ear, than seemeth to the eye</l>
<l>The wild white radiance of the maiden <add>M</add>oon,</l>
<l>When from some cape's dark beak her rising mass</l>
<l>Looks o'er the ocean - even with such a voice,</l>
<l>So keen, so silvery, did she ask me then,</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long? Oh, tell me where!"</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">With thrilling ears and heart, I heard - but felt</l>
<l>Pass from me forth a cry of sudden fear,</l>

<l>Like a fa<del>i</del>r meteor in some dismal marsh:</l>
<l>How long I dreamt not - but the thrilling warmth</l>
<l>That like the new birth of a passionate bliss,</l>
<l>Erewhile had searched me to the quick, again</l>
<l>Shuddered within me, - more and more, - until</l>
<l>Mine eyes had opened under <hi rend="it">two</hi> that made</l>
<l>All else like darkness; and upon my cheek</l>
<l>A breath that seemed the final spirit of health</l>

<l>The fond enquiry of that silver voice</l>

<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long? Oh, tell me where!"</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">And when she thus in her so wondrous way</l>

<l>Unsearchable recess of soul supreme -</l>
<l>Some depth of the Eternal! echoing thence</l>
<l>Through the sweet meanings of its spirit speech,</l>
<l>The fond enquiry that awoke me now:</l>

<l>Close at her side reclined upon a couch</l>
<l>Of purple, blazoned all with stars of gold,</l>
<l>Tremblingly rayed with spiculated gems, -</l>
<l>And argent moons, - and bearing cushions, rough</l>
<l>(Save where they met the flexure of the arm)</l>
<l>With sheaves of flowers in glowing tissue wrought.</l>
<l>Thus sat we, looking forth; nor did I marvel,</l>
<l>As her's now led my vision, to remark</l>
<l>How the broad <add>L</add>ake, with its green shelving shores,</l>
<l>Swarming with honey-yielding flowers, or hung</l>
<l>With vines in masses, bunched with fruit; and thence</l>
<l>The prospect all - hills, skies, and winding vales,</l>
<l>And bloomy forests of unspeakable beauty,</l>
<l>Were basking in the blessedness of a day</l>
<l>So goldenly serene, that never yet</l>
<l>The perfect power of life-essential light</l>
<l>Might so enrobe, since Paradise was lost,</l>
<l>The common world inhabited by man.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">I saw all this surpassing beauty - but</l>
<l>I saw it thus through her superior life,</l>

<l>Her mystic moon-like sphere of being, that seemed</l>
<l>(Transpicuously) the inexhaustible source</l>
<l>Of holiest motives, and truth-breathing thoughts -</l>
<l>Breathing abroad like odours from a flower;</l>
<l>And orient idealities; and more</l>
<l>Of rosy passion, and affectionate joy,</l>
<l>And earnest tenderness, than many souls</l>
<l>Of earth's most fervent and ecstatic daughters</l>
<l>United might possess; all interflowing</l>
<l>Through the fine issues of a love at once</l>
<l>Wilful and nice, but sanctioned none the less</l>
<l>By its so brilliant purity. Nor might</l>
<l>The glassy <add>L</add>ake below more quickly give</l>
<l>Nimble impressions of the coming wind's</l>
<l>Invisible footsteps, dimpling swift along,</l>
<l>Than instant tokens of communion sweet</l>
<l>With outward beauty's subtle spirit, passed</l>
<l>Forth from her eyes, and thence in lambent waves</l>
<l>Suffused and lightened o'er the splendid whole</l>
<l>Of her bright visage, or about her head</l>
<l>In spheres ran raying like a glory of bliss!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>But as upon the wonder of her beauty</l>
<l>My soul now feasted, even till it seemed</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">SHE ceased: and a deep tingling silence fell</l>
<l>Instantly round, - silence complete, and yet</l>
<l>Instinct as with a breathing sweetness, left</l>
<l>By the rare spirit of her voice foregone:</l>
<l>Even as the fragrance of a flower were felt</l>
<l>Pervading the mute air, through which erewhile</l>
<l>It had been borne by the delighted hand</l>
<l>Of some sweet-thoughted Maiden. Turning then</l>
<l>Her bright face tow'rds me, as I stood entranced,</l>
<l>Yet with keen wonder stung, she said, "I love thee!</l>
<l>As first love loveth - utterly! But ah!</l>
<l>This Love itself - this purple-winged Love -</l>
<l>This spirit-enriching Spirit of delight,</l>
<l>Is but a honey-bee of Paradise,</l>
<l>That only in the morning glory dares</l>
<l>To range abroad - and when a vagrant most</l>
<l>Adventure out into the common world</l>
<l>Of man and woman; - thither lured by sight</l>
<l>Of some sweet human soul that blooms apart,</l>
<l>Untainted by a rank soil's weedy growths: -</l>
<l>Lured thither thus - yet being, even then,</l>
<l>But wilfully wandering away - away</l>
<l>From its pure birth-place (innocent only there!)</l>
<l>And whereunto it must again return,</l>
<l>Or forfeit else its natal passport, - <hi rend="it">ere</hi></l>
<l>The dread night cometh. Yet of how great worth</l>
<l>Is all foregone affection? In the spring</l>
<l>Of even the lowliest love, how many rich</l>
<l>And gracious things that could not else have been,</l>
<l>Grow up like flowers, and breathe a perfume forth</l>
<l>That never leaves again the quickened sense</l>
<l>It once hath hit, as with a fairy's wand,</l>
<l>However fanciful may seem at last</l>
<l>The charm through which it came." And having said</l>
<l>These mystic sentences, so wild and sweet,</l>
<l>And memorably mournful, - lo, her eyes</l>
<l>Ran o'er with lustres as they opened up</l>
<l>Under mine own now melancholy gaze.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">And thus we stood, turned one unto the other,</l>
<l>Till Love again grew glad even from the rich</l>
<l>And wine-like luxury and voluptous worth</l>
<l>Of its own tear-showers, shed as from the heart!</l>
<l>Forth then once more we looked - silently happy:</l>
<l>Alas! not long: for with a short low gasp</l>
<l>Of sudden fear, she started; nor might I</l>
<l>Stand unalarmed. For hark! within the Tower,</l>
<l>A sound of strenuous steps approaching fast,</l>
<l>Rang upward, as it seemed, from the hard slabs</l>
<l>Of a steep-winding stair; amd soon the huge</l>
<l>And brazen portal that behind us shut,</l>
<l>Burst open! with a clang of loosened bolts -</l>
<l>A clang like thunder, that went rattling out</l>
<l>Against the echoes of the distant hills.</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">With deafened ears and looks aghast, I turned</l>
<l>Tow'rds the harsh noise - there to behold, between</l>
<l>The mighty jambs in the Tower-wall from which</l>
<l>The door swung inward, a tremendous Form!</l>
<l>A horrid gloomy Form! that shapeless seemed,</l>
<l>And yet, in its so monstrous bulk, to Man</l>
<l>A hideous likeness bare! Still more and more</l>
<l>Deform it grew, as forth it swelled, and then</l>
<l>Its outlines, shadowing forward, so were lost</l>
<l>On all sides in a grizzly haze, that hung</l>
<l>Vaguely about them, - even as dull grey clouds</l>
<l>Beskirt a coming Tempest's denser mass,</l>
<l>That thickens still internally, and shows</l>
<l>The murkiest in the midst - yea, murkiest there</l>
<l>Where big with fate, and hid in solid gloom,</l>

</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Then with a motion as of one dark stride</l>
<l>Shadowing forward, and outstretching straight</l>
<l>One vague-seen arm, from my reluctant grasp</l>
<l>It tore the radiant Lady, muttering <hi rend="it">"This</hi></l>

<l>Were like low guttural thunders heard afar,</l>
<l>Outgrowling from the clouded gorges wild</l>
<l>Of neighboring mountains, when a sultry storm</l>
<l>Is pondering in its dark pavilions there,</l>
<l>And concentrating, like a hill-born host,</l>
<l>Ere it rush valeward; and, as suddenly,</l>
<l>Seized by the other, I was backward thrown</l>
<l>Within the Tower, and heard ere I could rise</l>
<l>From the cold platform, the huge brazen door</l>
<l>Drawn harshly grating to; its beamlike bar</l>

<l>Within - without; - all silent, stirless, cold!</l>
<l>What was my doom? And where was she, my late</l>
<l>So luminous delight? Gone! Reft away</l>
<l>So strangely, terribly! and I myself,</l>
<l>For some all-unimaginable cause,</l>

<l>Was as an age, kept trickling on, but there</l>
<l>Brought no release - no hope; - brought not a breath</l>
<l>That spake of fellowship, or even of life,</l>
<l>Out of myself - my lonely self! I stood</l>
<l>Utterly blank - utterly shrunken up,</l>
<l>In marble-cold astonishment of heart!</l>
<l>And when at length I cast a desperate look -</l>
<l>A look so desperate that the common gift</l>
<l>Of vision stung me like a deadly curse -</l>
<l>Up and around, pure pity of myself</l>
<l>So warmed and loosened from my brain the pent</l>
<l>And icy anguish, that its load at once</l>

<l>Till resignation, that so balmy sweet</l>
<l>Meek flower of Grief which hath its roots in tears.</l>

<l>That seemed to cut the Tower's whole round in twain,</l>
<l>A second door - shut, and all clamped with brass,</l>
<l>And rough with rows of monstrous iron studs,</l>
<l>And which might haply have thence opened in</l>
<l>Athwart some stairway (as I guessed) that led</l>

<l>Into the darkness; even as a fish,</l>
<l>Through the dense medium of its element,</l>

<l>And to and fro I paced, hour after hour,</l>
<l>And heard my step, the only sound to me</l>
<l>In all the wide world, throb with a dull blow</l>
<l>Down through the hollow Tower that seemed to yawn</l>
<l>Immeasurably beneath me, - as it were</l>
<l>A monstrous well whose wide waste mouth was bridged</l>
<l>By that dull-quaking strip of floor alone</l>
<l>On which I darkling strode. Yet on I kept</l>
<l>Pacing, though horrified. Hour after hour</l>
<l>Passed as if clotting at the heart of Time -</l>
<l>Each an eternity of wild expectation,</l>
<l>And weary astonishment! - hour after hour!</l>
<l>And yet no other sound had being there,</l>
<l>Though, as I knew, one live, unmoving Thing</l>
<l>So near me stood in that blind solitude -</l>
<l>Stood waiting - wherefore? by the inner door.</l>

<l rend="indent">So passed that <add>S</add>ong: (of which the drift alone</l>
<l>Is here reached after in such leaden speech</l>
<l>As uncharmed mortals use.) And when its tones</l>
<l>Out tow'rds the mountains in the dark afar,</l>
<l>Had wasted, I grew sensible, methought,</l>
<l>Of seasonable change; - that now the Cell</l>
<l>Kept clarifying till the darkness seemed</l>
<l>Marbled with grey; and then the <add>S</add>teed again,</l>
<l>With his strange dragon-claws and half-spread wings,</l>
<l>And eke the tripod, where it still had stood,</l>
<l>Figured like shadows through the thinning gloom,</l>
<l>And gradually thence, by just the same</l>
<l>Degrees reversed in which they'd faded there</l>
<l>Into the darkness as the night advanced,</l>
<l>Came forth in full development again.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">It was the Dawn: and thus it clearing kept,</l>
<l>Till through the eastern port a golden rod</l>
<l>Of light fell transiently, and so bespake</l>
<l>The sunrise! Oh, it was a desolate pass,</l>
<l>To feel, - immured in that relentless <add>K</add>eep, -</l>
<l>How on the purple hills the sun was then</l>
<l>Rejoicing in his glory! Then to know</l>
<l>That he was wheeling up the heaven, and o'er</l>
<l>My prison-roof; - hour after hour, to think</l>
<l>How he was tracking with a step of fire</l>
<l>His midway course, and loudening through the world</l>
<l>The thunder of its universal life!</l>
<l>Or how his mighty orb had sloped in Time's</l>
<l>Descending scale, and thence was glorying down</l>
<l>Into the crimson-waves of some wide sea</l>
<l>Beyond the Hesperides! But this, alas!</l>
<l>Was my dread fate while seven times day and night</l>
<l>So wearily came, - so wore away; and yet</l>
<l>I slept not! nor (to my amazement) there,</l>
<l>Through all this drear time, did the wintry tooth</l>
<l>Of hunger gnaw within my corporal frame!</l>
<l>No thirst inflamed me! While by the grim door</l>
<l>Which seemed to shut athwart some stairway, stood</l>
<l>That strange, unmoving, dragon-footed Steed,</l>
<l>As from the first, - and there the tripod, placed</l>
<l>As if to aid some fugitive to mount</l>
<l>At once - and fly! Mere wonder at my doom,</l>
<l>So unimaginably wild and vague,</l>
<l>Relieved the else-fixed darkness of despair.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">But on the seventh night, in the stillness, - hark!</l>
<l>What might I hear? A step? - a small light step,</l>
<l>That by the stair ascending, swiftly came</l>
<l>Straight to the inner door - then stopt. Alas!</l>
<l>The black leaf opened not; and yet, the while,</l>
<l>In evidence of some bright Being that out</l>
<l>Beyond it stood, a rainbow radiance through</l>
<l>Its solid breadth, in subtle wave on wave,</l>
<l>Came flushing, - even as a sunset-glow</l>
<l>Through some dense cloud upon the verge of heaven,</l>
<l>In swift rich curves wells percolating forth:</l>
<l>So came it - filling all the <add>C</add>ell at length</l>
<l>With rosy lights that in the darkness fumed</l>
<l>Like luminous odors; at the scent of which,</l>
<l>The mystic <add>S</add>teed, so rigid until then,</l>
<l>Moved, and spread wide his glimmering bat-like wings.</l>
<l>When hark! deep down in the mysterious Tower,</l>
<l>Another step? Yea, the same strenuous tramp</l>
<l>That once before I'd heard big-beating up,</l>
<l>Came following - till a low sad cry without</l>
<l>Went to my heart, and I might hear ensue</l>
<l>A struggle as of one forced down the stair</l>
<l>By that so ruthless Guard! - down, till the <add>C</add>ell</l>
<l>Again had darkened, and the Tower itself</l>
<l>Stood once more as in some mute void of Time,</l>
<l>Or depth of distance infinitely out,</l>
<l>Achingly still. But not for long! Again</l>
<l>The Monster's hateful tramp came booming up,</l>
<l>Quake above quake that with a shudden stopt</l>
<l>Dead at the door. It opened; and he stood</l>
<l>In dubious presence 'twixt the mighty jambs,</l>
<l>Filling the whole wide space. But ere the Fiend</l>
<l><add>101.</add></l>
<l>Might enter farther, rage and hate at once</l>
<l>Possessed me, and I charged him! For awhile</l>
<l>His horrible glooms voluminously vague,</l>
<l>Yet with a smothering pressure in their folds,</l>
<l>Involved me! - concentrating more and more.</l>
<l>And lapping closer in yet denser coils,</l>
<l>Every dread moment! But my agony now,</l>
<l>My pain, and hate, and loathing, - all had grown</l>
<l>Into so vast a horroe, that methought</l>
<l>I burst with irresistible strength away!</l>
<l>Rushed through the door, and down the stairway - down</l>
<l>An endless depth; till a portcullis, hinged</l>
<l>In the Tower's basement, opened to my flight!</l>
<l>No sooner had I passed it, than it fell</l>
<l>In thunder to<del>o</del>! and thence my passage lay</l>
<l>Along the difficult ledges of a rock</l>
<l>Against whose base the Lake's long ripple lapped.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">And when at last, breathless and faint, I paused</l>
<l>In that so giddy flight methought I saw</l>
<l>The lustrous Lady up through the lit air</l>
<l>Ascending, with a steadfast downward look</l>
<l>Of parting recognition - full of love,</l>
<l>But painless, passionless. Upward she passed,</l>
<l>Above the Tower, and o'er the clouds, - and when</l>
<l>Her radiance melted through heaven's marble dome</l>
<l>And left it vacant in its infinite vastness,</l>
<l>All things methought had changed, and I was there</l>
<l>Standing alone in a wide waste that stretched</l>
<l>On all hands out - illimitably out!</l>
<l>Standing alone in a waste universe,</l>
<l>That showed, as under an abortive dawn,</l>
<l>Its grey immensity, and nothing more!</l>
<l>Still, empty, objectless! - and thereupon</l>
<l>There fell back on my soul a sense of loss</l>
<l>So bleak, so desolate, that with a wild</l>
<l>Sleep startling outcry, suddenly I awoke!</l>
<l>Awoke, to find it but a Dream of Wonder!</l>
<l>Yet ever since to fell as if some pure</l>
<l>And guardian Soul, out of the day and night,</l>
<l>Had passed for ever from the reach of Love!</l>
<l>Albeit I know, that to the Poet's mind,</l>
<l>No light, no loveliless it once hath known,</l>
<l>Though only through the mystery of a dream,</l>
<l>Is after lost; but in effect remains,</l>
<l>As comfort, or as wisdom, or as grace,</l>
<l>In union with its substance evermore -</l>

<l>Of <hi rend="it">His</hi> predestined influence on the world.</l>

<lg><l>One Summer morn, out of the sea-waves wild</l>
<l>A speck-like Cloud, the season's fatal child,</l>
<l>Came<del>ly</del> softly floating up the boundless sky,</l>
<l>And o'er the sun-parched hills all brown and dry.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Onward she glided, through the azure air</l>
<l>Borne by its motion without toil or care:</l>
<l>When looking down in her ethereal joy,</l>
<l>She marked Earth's moilers at their hard employ:</l>
<l>And - Oh! (she said) that by some act of grace</l>
<l>'Twere mine to succor yon o'erlabored race;</l>
<l>To give the hungry meat, the thirsty drink -</l>
<l>The thought of good is very sweet to think.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The day advanced - and the Cloud greater grew,</l>
<l>And greater: also her desire to do</l>
<l>Some charity to men, had more and more</l>
<l>As the long sultry Summer day on wore,</l>
<l>Greatened and warmed within her fleecy breast,</l>
<l>Like a dove fledgling in its downy nest.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The heat waxed fiercer, until all the land</l>
<l>Glared in the sun, as 'twere a monstrous brand,</l>
<l>And the shrunk rivers, few and far between,</l>
<l>Like molten metal lightened in the scene.</l>
<l>Ill could Earth's sons endure their toilsome state,</l>
<l>Though still they labored, for their need was great.</l>
<l>And many a long beseeching look they sped</l>
<l>Tow'rds that fair Cloud, with many a sigh, that said</l>
<l>We famish for thy bounty! For our sake</l>
<l>O break thou! in a showery blessing, break!</l>

<l rend="indent">I <hi rend="ul">feel</hi>, and fain would help you! said the Cloud,</l>
<l>And tow'rds the Earth her bounteous being bowed.</l>
<l>But then rememb'ring a tradition she</l>
<l>Had while a child learned from her native Sea,</l>
<l>That when a Cloud adventures from the skies</l>
<l>Too near the altar of the hills - it <hi rend="ul">dies</hi>!</l>
<l>Awhile she wavered and was blown about</l>
<l>Hither and thither, by the winds of doubt.</l>
<l>But in the midst of heaven, at length all still</l>
<l>She stood: - then suddenly, with an instant thrill</l>
<l>Of light, she said within herself - I <hi rend="ul">will</hi>!</l>
<l>Yea, in the glad strength of devotion, I</l>
<l>Will help you, though, in helping you, I <hi rend="ul">die</hi>!</l>

<l>O'er the parched <del>hills</del> fields in her angelic love</l>
<l>She spread her wings out like a brooding dove:</l>
<l>Till, as her purpose deepened, drawing near,</l>
<l>So God-like terrible did her front appear,</l>
<l>That men and beasts all trempled at the view,</l>
<l>And the woods bowed, - though well all creatures knew</l>

<l>Wide flashed then - yea, through all her full-grown form</l>
<l>The glory of her <hi rend="ul">will</hi>! the agony and the storm</l>
<l>Of Life's dire dread of Death, whose mortal threat</l>
<l>From Christ himself drew memorable sweat! -</l>

<l>Illumined all the illimitable air!</l>
<l>The thunder followed, a tremendous sound</l>
<l>Loud doubling and reverberating round!</l>
<l>Till one wide rumbling intonation rolled</l>
<l>Through all the shuddering mountains manifold!</l>
<l>Strong was her will, but stronger yet the power</l>
<l>Of Love, that now dissolved her in a shower,</l>
<l>Dropping in blessings, to impregn the Earth</l>
<l>With health and plenty at one blooming birth.</l>
<l>She bled in rain - bled unto death; but died</l>
<l>Only to higher being - Good beatified!</l>

<l>A splendid bow the freshened prospecr spann'd,</l>
<l>Like a celestial arc, as hung in air</l>
<l>By Angel artists, and as being there</l>
<l>The parting triumph of the Spirit pure</l>

<lg><l>I dreamt I was a Sculpt<del>ure</del><add>or</add>, and had wrought</l>
<l>Out of a towering adamantine crag</l>
<l>A mighty Figure, - giant-limbed, and faced</l>
<l>Planted aloft upon the levelled cone</l>
<l>Of a vast tumulus that seemed to swell</l>
<l>Above the sinking outline of the view</l>

<l>In swift succession, though extending wide,</l>
<l>Did kindle, as if touch-struck, into one</l>
<l>Vast spreading litter of wind-tattered sheets</l>

<l>Much was there also in its cast, that seemed</l>

<head>THE FLIGHT OF FAITH. <lb/>(<hi rend="it">From Genius Lost.</hi>) <lb/><del>BY CHARLES HARPUR</del></head>

<lg><l>Thus, in the morning of my life, have I</l>
<l>No happiness rooted in the earth, to hold</l>
<l>My spirit to the actual. All my hopes</l>
<l>Are blown away by adverse worldly winds -</l>
<l>Blown sheer away, - out of the world, to <lb/>seek</l>
<l>Such solace as may be derived from far</l>
<l>And lonely flights of Faith. Yet even these</l>
<l>Only divert, not satisfy, my soul.</l>
<l>Still when her wings refuse them wearied <lb/>out</l>
<l>By so wild-willed an aeronaut as I,</l>
<l>Having no nearer comfort, even as now,</l>
<l>Their foregone influence do I meditate, -</l>
<l>Tracing them upward in their heavenward <lb/>track</l>
<l>Through the similitudes of many things.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">As through an ocean of up-rolling mist</l>
<l>Amid the morning Alps, a morning bird</l>
<l>Keeps soaring, trustful of the risen sun,</l>
<l>Who then is turning all the mountain tops</l>

<l>It shoots at length into the cloudless light,</l>
<l>And gleams a bird of fire: So Faith up <lb/>mounts</l>
<l>Through the earth's misty tribulations - <lb/>up</l>
<l>Into the clear of the eternal world;</l>
<l>Unfainting, fervent, till with happy wings</l>
<l>Dispreading full amid the rays of God.</l>
<l>It glories, gleaming like the Alpine bird.</l>
<l>- But wearying in her flight, even Faith re- <lb/>turns,</l>
<l>As does the bird, - returns into the mist</l>
<l>That shutteth down all less adventurous <lb/>life:</l>
<l>But stronger for the mighty vision left,</l>
<l>And livelier for the warmth upon her wings.</l>

</lg>

<lg><l>Thus she: and then my Boy, as nigh</l>
<l>The couch he watched, this lullaby</l>
<l>Sang softly - "Rest thee, stranger, rest!</l>
<l rend="indent">Thy nedd is past and freinds are near;</l>
<l>No longer by the heat opprest,</l>
<l rend="indent">Sleep, nor consent to dream in fear</l>
<l rend="indent">Of the remorseless tiger here!</l>
<l>Sleep, till the first shot glance of morn</l>
<l>Inflame the dews on every thorn,</l>
<l>And from the sun-kindled sea</l>
<l>The earliest breeze comes braceingly"</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Then I: - "And when thou dost depart</l>
<l rend="indent">Again upon thy desert track,</l>

<l>Three ample meals to cheer thy heart</l>
<l rend="indent">Shall store the wallet at thy back;</l>
<l>And still before thee, strong in love,</l>
<l>May the Good Spirit's shadows move,</l>
<l>Preventing every shape of wrath</l>
<l>And danger on thy lonely path.</l>
<l>And when thou hungerest again</l>
<l>Upon the dry unyeilding plain,</l>
<l>Even to thy wish; may'st thou discry</l>
<l>Some hospitable village nigh:</l>
<l>And whereso'ere thy strength shall flag</l>
<l rend="indent">From thirst, may there fresh breezes bring</l>
<l rend="indent">About thee a cool murmuring</l>
<l>Of water, from some fissured crag</l>
<l>Down slipping into mossy tanks,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or brimming from its shaded well,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or winding out of some dim dell</l>
<l>Into a rill with willowy banks."</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>But when ere too on mats spread out,</l>
<l rend="indent">In Sleeps descended cloud reclined,</l>
<l>Strange faltering fears, - a shapeless rout, -</l>
<l rend="indent">Kept peopling my prophetic mind.</l>
<l>And then I dreamt of her I'd loved</l>
<l rend="indent">who stealthily, methought, draw nigh</l>
<l rend="indent">And fixed me with her mournful eye,</l>
<l>Till, with a mighty sorrow moved,</l>
<l rend="indent">I wept, though dimly wonderning why.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>Still as I slumbered, many Forms</l>
<l rend="indent">Moved round me, or kept hovering ore;</l>
<l rend="indent">And voices that belonged to yore</l>
<l>To kindred gathered to the worms,</l>

<pb n="92" facs="A97/00000093.jpg"/>

<l>Even when I started from my dream</l>
<l>Did from the dark yet sounding seem.</l>
<l>And closer too, than wont, my Boy</l>
<l rend="indent">Clung to his boding Sire that night, -</l>
<l>His little dreams were not of joy,</l>
<l rend="indent">For he would shudder with affright,</l>
<l>Whene'ere in louder gusts the breeze</l>
<l>Swept through the overdoming trees.</l>

<head>Part IV</head>

<lg><l>At length I slept too soundly! - Cries</l>
<l rend="indent">Were shrilling in mine ears,</l>
<l>And yet I could not wake! mine eyes</l>
<l rend="indent">Seemed loaded with a thousand years: -</l>
<l>Till wide hands hands grasped my throat! and then</l>
<l rend="indent">I woke to see; - my children bound!</l>
<l>And then six tiger visaged men</l>
<l rend="indent">Were feircely pressing round!</l>
<l>And he, - our Guest, was standing there,</l>
<l rend="indent">The unmasked leader of the crew!</l>
<l>Yes, he, in payment for our care,</l>
<l rend="indent">They wrong they did us, bad them do,</l>
<l>In vain I showerd his feet with tears,</l>
<l rend="indent">He dashed them on my face, till they</l>
<l>Were red with blood! whereat his sneers</l>
<l rend="indent">Were levelled as he turned away,</l>
<l>And bade his villans drag us where</l>
<l rend="indent">His lurking vessel lay</l>
<l>Like a sea-monster in its lair</l>
<l rend="indent">Within a mangrove shrouded bay, -</l>
<l>Distant seven weary leagues or more;</l>
<l>And where, like wolves, the day before</l>
<l rend="indent">He and his gang had prowled for prey</l>

<pb n="93" facs="A97/00000094.jpg"/>

<l>The rest is brief: they sold us here -</l>
<l rend="indent">They tore the parent from the child!</l>
<l>And curst them for their shreiks so drear,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or scourged them for their greif so wild!</l>

<l rend="indent">Within them, like the snakes of hell!)</l>
<l>Next visiting my native coast,</l>
<l>One morning, gastly as a ghost</l>
<l>Rose raging, murder mad, and slew</l>
<l>With sudden onslaught half his crew!</l>
<l>And though the rest with chains of strength</l>
<l>Did bolt him to the deck at length</l>
<l>Amid the murdered in their gore,</l>
<l>Vain were all fetters! With a roar</l>
<l rend="indent">Wild as a wounded pard's he wrencht</l>
<l rend="indent">His gybes apart, the hoop unclencht</l>
<l>From round his trunk, the bolts uptore</l>
<l>Leapt from the ship, and to the shore</l>
<l rend="indent">Though by the thundering surf deep drencht,</l>
<l>Swam shouting! made the beach and fled</l>
<l>Into the jungles, where, tis said,</l>

<head><add>88</add> <lb/>Preface.</head>

<p>The first draft of the following Descriptive Poem was written many years <lb/>ago, and referred to a period yet earlier, when the habits and pastimes <lb/>of the inland-dwelling Colonists were much more simple than they are <lb/>at present, and when the horse was possession too rare and valuable <lb/>to be used in the rough hap-hazzards of a Bush Hunt, or even, <lb/>except on great emergency, upon a mountain journey. Nay, during <lb/>the early Colonial period to which it refers, even a gun was a <lb/>somewhat <del><unclear></unclear></del> scarce article, or one not often employed in Kangaroo <lb/>hunting, while powder and shot were far too expensive to be blazed <lb/>away freely. That <hi rend="ul">golden</hi> prosperity which has made us so luxurious, <lb/>and even prodigal, as a community of Colonists, is of a comparatively <lb/>recent growth - as recent in fact as the auriferous discoveries <lb/>which it followed, and which have mainly contributed to it.</p>

<p>The Poem is designed to picture a morning in the mountains, <lb/>with a Kangaroo Hunt for the centre and pivot of the performance: <lb/><hi rend="ul">one</hi> hunt only, because there would be too much sameness in a succession <lb/>of "runs" for particular description. For the purpose, however, of bringing <lb/>as many characteristic circumstances as possible into this <hi rend="ul">one</hi>, the <lb/>Kangaroo is ca<add>r</add>ried over more ground than he would, with swift <lb/>hounds at his heels, be likely to cover in an actual case, unless endowed <lb/>with an extraordinary degree of both speed and endurance. But to render <lb/>this the more probable, he is allowed, through and error of his pursuers, <lb/>to ger considerably a-head of them about the middle of the Hunt. <lb/>And also, in keeping the hunters well up with the hounds, for the <lb/>sake of imparting a wholeness and an animation to that part of <lb/>the description, many advantages are thrown into them, in the <lb/>cast of the ground and otherwise, which they would not often be <lb/>favored with in any given locality.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="A97/00000111.jpg"/>

<p><add>89</add> <lb/>The personal digressions in the fifth Part are not indulged <lb/>in for their own sake merely. They are a part of the design of <lb/>the Poem, being introduced for the purpose of filling up as <lb/>pleasingly as the scope and keeping of the subject admitted, the pause <lb/>which is there given to the description of the kangaroo's flight and <lb/>the pursuit of the hounds; - there happening to be, in these respects, <lb/>just then, nothing worthy of particular mention, after the advantage <lb/>accruing to the former, through an error of the latter, which is noticed <lb/>in the conclusion of Part IV.</p>

<p>The Scenery of the Poem, as a whole, does not answer to any <lb/>particular locality. But such of the more remarkable features of <lb/>Australian scenery as the Author was acquainted with, have been <lb/>brought together (as in a pictorial composition) in the several <lb/>descriptions. Those, for example, in the body of the piece, are suitable, <lb/>in the main, to those of almost any of our wild mountain districts; <lb/>while the prospect given in the Introduction (as thw whole of the first <lb/>Part may be considered) might be made, with trifling allowances, <lb/>to apply to many of the newer Settlements on the banks of our inland <lb/>streams - around which the face of nature, under the improving <lb/>operations of civilised man, has already yielded up much, and is <lb/>daily resigning more, of its aboriginal cast and character. And on <lb/>this head it is to be <del>observed</del> further observed, that the mountains <lb/>amongst which the Hunt is supposed to be laid, though bold <lb/>and even sublime in many of their aspects, are not generally either <lb/>very lofty or very precipitous. They are, in fact, craggy hills rather <lb/>than mountains - the real mountains ranging immediately at the <lb/>back, though often extending forward into the midst of them, in <lb/>the shape of a gigantic bluff or of an abrupt elbow: and though in <lb/>many places perilously craggy, they are yet wound along and <lb/>shelfed as it were by grassy terraces, almost void of rooks, and <lb/>letting off laterally into slopes of open forest - the whole together <lb/>forming an accessible though <add>a</add> somewhat broken and difficult <lb/>coursing country.</p>

<p>But in the above scenic conditions, there are ample scope and <pb n="111" facs="A97/00000112.jpg"/> <add>90</add> <lb/>materials for the picturesque: and, moreover, I believe that, as an object of <lb/>sublimity, there is no great difference between a mountain two thousand <lb/>feet high and one twice that height, when beheld separately. Nay, the <lb/>lesser mountain, if more precipitous, and bold in its outlines, will be <lb/>even the sublimer object of the twain - and this, too, the nearer we approach <lb/>it. Mere bulk, as an element <del><unclear></unclear></del> of the wonderful, is more <lb/>dependent upon the bodily eye, and also upon instant objective comparison, <lb/>than any other constituent of the Sublime; and hence it is, that over a <lb/>certain height in a mountain - say two thousand feet or so - it requires <lb/>a very great addition indeed, to make a difference that is immediately <lb/>or ocularly perceptible - except at such a distance <hi rend="ul">on the horizon</hi>, <lb/>as would all but nullify the effect of any sublime superiority therefrom <lb/>accruing.</p>

<p>At all events, for poetic purposed, mere bulk need not to be <lb/>very much relied upon or primarily sought after. The suggestiveness <lb/>of the treatment in matters of magnitude - the imaginative <lb/>manner of handling them - is nearly everything. Hence Olympus <lb/>and the highest Himmilayan, to which it is but a mole-hill, may be <lb/>made to look equally mighty in verse. Nay, with the Ideal bending <lb/>over ir, and enskying it as it were with the poetic heaven of <lb/>the historic Past, the larger majesties will dwell, like the Homeric <lb/>Gods, upon the peaks of Olympus. The scenic imagery of the <lb/>Bible, though often so ruggedly sublime, was the product of a <lb/>country whose mountains, speaking literally, are but rocky hills. See <lb/>also the mighty effect which Shakspere has wrought, in poetic picture, <lb/>and by virtue of a certainh mental intensity of treatment, out of the <lb/>comparatively insignificant Cliff of Dover. Nay, a rock rift of <lb/>but twenty feet in depth is a sturdy miniature of the wildest <lb/>Alpine gorge, and when beheld with such a reference, through an <lb/>imaginary process of self-dimination, becomes savagely sublime. <lb/>So much does the grandeur of bulk depend upon the grandeur of <lb/>form; and both these again, however strikingly blended, <lb/>may be raised almost immeasurably by poetic intensification.</p>

<p>Moreover, - except when a limited local reference happens to <pb n="112" facs="A97/00000113.jpg"/> <add>91</add> <lb/>be historical to the subject, - the Poet, in picturing nature, <lb/>should never pin himself to the particular, or to the locally present. <lb/>The Proseman may do this at all times, and insist upon the <lb/>merit of his parochial closenessl but the Poet must not: for <lb/>if he do, his draft will be but a vague <hi rend="ul">account</hi> at the best, - not <lb/>a poetic picture. But he should paint her primarily through his <lb/>imagination; and this the striking features and colors of many <lb/>scenes, which lie permanently gathered in his memory, becoming, <lb/>with their influences, idealised in the process, will be essentially <lb/>transfused up a <hi rend="ul">few</hi>, or even upon <hi rend="ul">one</hi> scene - one happy embodiment <lb/>of her wildest freaks, or one Eden-piece embathed with a luminous <lb/>atmosphere of sentiment. But never by wholesale will this transfusion <lb/>be made, or indiscriminately; but in judicious keeping with the design <lb/>and scope of his subject as a picture, and exactly according to its <lb/>special limits and likelihoods as a landscape. And though what is <lb/>thus painted may be raised in beauty or wildness above the average <lb/>of any given <del><unclear></unclear></del> exhibition of these qualities, it may yet, as a <lb/>picture, be profoundly true to Nature, or to that flow and expression <lb/>of character which such qualities best conform to, when we either <lb/>locally exalt or locally concentrate her style. Thus it is truth <lb/>sublimated, compressed, epitomised; - truth raised to its height, <lb/>or strained away through the alembic of invention from whatever <lb/>is unsightly or merely wearisome, and presented anew, though in <lb/>vision, in its selectest forms and possibilites. For though, as a <lb/>matter of art, it comes to <hi rend="ul">us</hi> or is presented through the invention <lb/>of the Poet, yet to <hi rend="ul">him</hi> it came, - not literally, as in the picture before <lb/>us, but in all the elements of that picture, - direct from Nature. <lb/>In fine, if the Poet has been wholly true to his missionary insight in <lb/>the first place, and to his re-creative instincts in the next, the <lb/>license taken, and the modifications made by art, with reach <lb/>only to its pictorial manner and assemblage of objects: in <lb/>its spirit it will still be very Nature; while in its effect, as <lb/>an esthetic success, it will be Something yet more precious - <lb/>a mind-enclosed possession, and thence a "joy for ever".</p>

<p><add>92</add> <lb/>The versification of the Poem throughout is designedly irregular, or what <lb/>is commonly thought to be so, - and indeed, <hi rend="ul">is</hi> so, under the established <lb/>standards. But when composing it, I concieved that such an unconfined, <lb/>many-metred structure of verse as might be varied and paragraphically <lb/>moulded (after the manner of a musical movement) to the peculiar <lb/>demands of every occasion, and appear therefore to result spontaneously <lb/>from the very nature of the things depicted, would be most conducive to <lb/>the effective treatment of a subject, the art-interest of which would depend <lb/>so largely upon its metrical vehicle. And though I have since become <lb/>aware that Coleridge has said something of a like purport in reference <lb/>to the versification of <add>his</add> Christabel, yet I can affirm that when <lb/>writing this piece I have never read a line of that Poem, or indeed, <lb/>of any production whatever that was professedly imitative of it, <lb/>either in respect of its style, or in any other respect. My design, <lb/>therefore, was so far original. And this design, I am sure, was <lb/>in itself a good one, however I may have failed in carrying it out. <lb/>But I do not think that I have therein failed. On the contrary, <lb/>I flatter myself, that the style of the verse, though it may not at <lb/>first be thought altogether pleasing by some readers, will yet, on a <lb/>second and more studied perusal, commend itself to the critical, <lb/>as being in the main appropriate to the matter - and if so, <lb/><hi rend="ul">essentially</hi> harmonious.</p>

<p><add>a</add> It is a very prevalent, but an erroneous notion, that the <lb/>birds of Australia are almost destitute of song. Often, indeed, <lb/>our birds are wanting in sweetness of voice, and their song is <lb/>yet more often defective, perhaps, in volume and contuinity. <lb/>But this is far from being the case universally. The magpie, <lb/>for a familiar instance, has not only a merry, but a most musical <lb/>chaunt. One set, in particular, of gurgling undertones which <lb/>this bird warbles as it were to itself, when perched up in the cool, <lb/>- that is, in some dense-topped oak or apple tree, of a hot <lb/>summer noontide, - is melodious to degree almost incredible.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of dwarf magpie, sometimes confounded by lax <lb/>observers with the batcher-bird, which is very notable for the extreme <lb/>beauty of its voice. When several of these birds are assembled together <lb/>in the same tree, or clump of trees, a concert of sweet sounds in the wonted <lb/>consequence, - sounds mellow and soothing as the purer tones of the <lb/>flute, with occasional clarionet-like outgushes that are enchantingly spirited <lb/>and musical. Of the notes of the true butcher-bird or "old soldier", I have <lb/>heard it admitted, even by persons somewhat prejudiced against everything <lb/>Australian, that in richness and volume they can compete with those of the <lb/>nightengale, though they fail to sustain the duel, in respecr of a certain <lb/>varied and impetuous continuity. Several of our smaller birds too -<lb/>birds yet nameless and fast becoming extinct - have a surpresing variety <lb/>of notes; and when many of such birds are heard (as I have heard <lb/>them) all warbling together, the effect is strikingly musical. Even the <lb/>cries of the many parrot kinds, though somewhat harsh and discordant, <lb/>are yet exceedingly gladsome. When indeed, of a summer evening <lb/>- up aloft in the apple or gum trees, - there happens to be a great <lb/>gathering together of the higher flying kinds - those which never alight <lb/>on the ground, the blue mountainer, with the greater and lesser green <lb/>parrakeet - there is afload in the air on all sides a mad merriment <lb/>of sound, that can only be well characterised as somewhat bewilderingly <lb/>hilarious. In newly settled localities, of a Spring or Autumn morning, <lb/>I have heard the whole forest vocally alive and as it were electric, <lb/>with the wild, shrill, intermixing peans of birds, than which, <lb/>in many instances, nothing could be more sweet and joyous, or <lb/>taking them altogether, more primatively exhilarating.</p>

<lg><l>Under the grey dawning skies,</l>
<l>Behold a band of Hunters meet</l>
<l>On the grassy swell of a gentle rise</l>
<l>Befringed with the wattle so golden and sweet,</l>

<l>Looms out from the fog where it thinnest lies</l>
<l>'Mid the boles of the saplings <add>a</add> slim;</l>
<l>And thrown from which, the eye commands</l>
<l>Clearings <add>b</add> and cultivated lands,</l>
<l>With rude-wrought homesteads islanded,</l>
<l>Or farther forth some new-built shed:</l>
<l>There a band of Hunters meet!</l>
