<div type="prose">

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, <lb/>In the following discourse <lb/>I propose:</p>

<p>I. To define the nature and <lb/>office of poetry; and, at the same <lb/>time, to rebut certain objections <lb/>as to its moral influence.</p>

<p>II. To discriminate or <lb/>contradistinguish the two <lb/>principal kinds or orders of <lb/>Poetry: that is, the Poetry of <lb/>Talent merely from the Poetry <lb/>of absolute Genius. <add>and</add></p>

<p>III. To treat of Versification, <lb/>as being the form in which the <lb/>poetical spirit has commonly <lb/>chosen to embody itself: <del>and</del></p>

<p><del>IV. To contrast the true with <pb facs="C386/0005.jpg"/> <unclear></unclear> Descriptive Poetry.</del></p>

<div type="prose">

<p>I. In the <del><unclear></unclear></del> recorded opinions <lb/>of all men of indubitable <lb/>refinement, and of comprehensive <lb/>intellect, Poetry has ever been <lb/>accounted a high and sacred <lb/>thing. Impassioning the <lb/>master spirits of all time, <lb/>those of a merely mechanical <lb/>order excepted, it has been <lb/>crowned by their united <lb/>authority with the appellation <lb/>of the Divine Art. Nor has <lb/>this empyreal distinction been <lb/>unworthily accorded to an <lb/>Attainment, which is the <lb/>chastened result of an indwelling <lb/>love of Beauty and Truth in <lb/>their essence, and which <pb facs="C386/0006.jpg"/> constitutes in Man an ,lb/>afinity with the Seraph. What- <lb/>-ever is constituent in a <lb/>disposition to natural piety, <lb/>and all that is elemental in <lb/>human aptitude for a state <lb/>of complete intellectual liberty, <lb/>are equally as essential to the <lb/>full growth and maturity of <lb/>poetic genius, and of the critical <lb/>capacity also, by which its finer <lb/>creations can be duly appreciated <lb/>and enjoyed. And it is thus, <lb/>because Poetry, like Religion, <lb/>is a going forth in soul <lb/>after the Perfect and the Infinite; <lb/>and because, like Freedom, it is <lb/>and inexclusive realization <del><unclear></unclear></del> <lb/>and enjoyment of the universal <lb/>royalty of Mind. Mere worldlings <lb/>indeed, and common-place <pb facs="C386/0007.jpg"/> philosophers, may be prone to despise <lb/>the mental riches of the Muse, <lb/>and to confine, <add n="1">-</add> theoretically, <add n="2">at least -</add> the <lb/>influences disposing to poetic <lb/>feeling within the narrow <lb/>boundaries of their own spiritual <lb/>vision; but the more gifted children <lb/>of Taste know, on the contrary, <lb/>that <hi rend="ul">those</hi> <add>riches of <del>thought &amp; feeling</del> the soul</add> are amongst the most <lb/>valuable legacies of the Past, <lb/>and that <hi rend="ul">these</hi> <add><del><unclear></unclear></del> rare influences</add> have being in all <lb/>that is sublime and beautiful <lb/>in the universe, to replenish <add>and connect</add> it <lb/>as a whole with <del n="1">a</del> <add><del n="2"><unclear></unclear></del></add> subtler and <lb/><del n="1"><unclear></unclear></del> <add n="1">most</add> exquisite <del n="2">unity</del> <add n="2"><unclear></unclear></add> of <del n="3">Love</del> <add n="3"><del n="4">and delight</del></add> <add n="4">delight.</add> <lb/>And thus boundlessly prevalent, <lb/>these influences are but <lb/>ingathered, as to a centre, by the <lb/>sovereign imagination of the <lb/>Poet; not so much for <pb facs="C386/0008.jpg"/> self-enjoyment, as again to be <lb/>given forth in immortal verse, <lb/>condensed and melodised, and <lb/>genial with the fertility of passion; <lb/>- and it is only upon their <lb/>having passed through this <lb/>process, that they are perfected <lb/>in the power of causing the <lb/>hard heart of the common <lb/>world to moisten while listening <lb/>to the eloquent appeal, and to gush <lb/>over with unwonted bounty -<lb/>even as the living waters were <lb/>elicited from the rock in Hored <lb/>by the stroke of Moses's rod.</p>

<p>Still I am aware, that <lb/>amongst several virtuous ans respectable <lb/>sections of educated society, there exists, <lb/>or did very recently exist, a strong <lb/>pre-possession in disfavor of poetry. <lb/>I do not, however, infer from this, <pb facs="C386/0009.jpg"/> that there is any <del>vital <unclear></unclear></del> actual <lb/>decay of imaginative sympathy <lb/>amongst even these orders of readers. <lb/>On the contrary, I believe, that in <lb/>such circles, the ideal <del>requirements</del> <add>necessities</add> <lb/>of our nature, poetical as well as <lb/>musical and pictorial, <del n="1">are in</del> <add n="1">will <del n="2">always</del></add> <add n="2">forever</add> <lb/><del>constant and harmonious pace</del> <add>be measurable by the</add> <lb/><del>with</del> the progress of all <hi rend="ul">real</hi> <lb/>refiniment; and that the <lb/>disrelish alluded to <add>it <unclear></unclear> not exists</add> is owing <lb/>chiefly, if not solely, to the evil <lb/>uses to which compositions in this <lb/>kind have been prostituted by <lb/>certain Writers, both ancient and <lb/>modern, of great Wit <add>oftentimes</add> depraved <lb/>genius. But deeply as the <lb/>Poetic Muse may have been <lb/>sinned against by such Writers, <lb/>it yet behoves the refined <pb facs="C386/0010.jpg"/>and <del>philosophical</del> <add>influential</add> rightly to dis- <lb/>-tinguish <del>between her</del> <add>and separate from her</add> proper <lb/>tendencies, <del>and the</del> <add>that</add> moral alloy <lb/><del>with</del> <add>through</add> which these have always been <lb/>more or less <del>darkened and</del> debased <lb/>by the corruption of her children. <lb/>Her true vocation is <del>at once</del> to <lb/>quicken, exalt and purify, our <lb/>noble<add n="1">st</add> and <del n="1">most</del> <add n="2"><del n="2">more</del> most</add> exquisite passions; <lb/>and by informing the imagination <lb/>with <del>wisdom-suggesting</del> <add>idealism of the</add> beauty, both <lb/>to enlarge <add>our capacity of pathetic feeling</add> and recompense our <lb/><del>capacities of pathetic feeling and</del> <add>powers of</add> <lb/>intellectual enjoyment. And further, <lb/>in national and social regards <lb/>it is her <del>office</del> <add>vocation</add> to illustrate whatever <lb/>is virtuous in design, and to glorify <lb/>all that is noble in action: taking <lb/>occasions also, from time to time, <lb/>to <del>pour forth the lightning</del> <add>explode the thunder</add> of her <lb/>indignation against every thing <pb facs="C386/0011.jpg"/> <pb facs="C386/0012.jpg"/> <pb facs="C386/0013.jpg"/> that may be mean and cowardly <lb/>in the people, or tyrannical <add>and corrupt</add> in their <lb/>rulers.</p>

<p>In another and more fanciful <lb/>view of the nature and office of Poesie, <lb/>- her creations may be said to stand <lb/>in such relation to ordinary life as <lb/>dreams do to the condition of slumber. <lb/>When the tone of this state is healthy <lb/>these are cheerful, full of promise, <lb/>beautifully fantastic. When <lb/>diseased, on the other hand, <lb/>they are boding, full of horror, <lb/>monstrously incongruous. So is it <lb/>with the creations of the Muse, <lb/>according as the individual <lb/>minds in which they are produced, <lb/>and the social soil on which they <lb/>are intended to operate, are morally <lb/>healthy or otherwise. And to <lb/>continue the analogy in the better <lb/>part of its agreement, her winged <lb/>things of Love are also, in their  <pb facs="C386/0014.jpg"/> forward flight, - like dreams, or <lb/>what we may suppose of dreams, -<lb/>sometimes prophetic. Like these <lb/>too, in a salubrious sphere, they <lb/>beautify the common and transmute <lb/>the terrible into the lovely. <del>They <lb/>convert the <unclear></unclear> of misfortune <lb/>into smiles of benevolence, and the <lb/>bitter glances of enmity into tears <lb/>of reconciliation.</del> They annihilate <lb/>distance as with the "wings of the <lb/>morning", and <add n="1">set</add> captivity <add n="2">at large</add> as <del>with</del> <add n="3">by</add> <lb/>the starry <del>liberties</del> <add><unclear>vasitude</unclear></add> of the universe. <lb/>In fine, they recall the past, en- <lb/>-chant the present, and realise the <lb/>future; - restore the lost, renew <lb/>the changed, enrich the poor, <lb/>and reunite, by an immortalised <lb/>sympathy, the living and the dead. <lb/><del n="1">And without them, - that is a <lb/>polite literature, society is a mere <lb/>machine for the <del n="2">conesition</del> <add><unclear></unclear></add></del> <pb facs="C386/0015.jpg"/>of bodily food, comfortably oiled <lb/>at the joints, and cozily wrapped in <lb/>lambs' wool. <add>- to keep it</add></p>

<p>With regard to the outcry <lb/>which has ever obtained more or <lb/>less amongst certain religious <lb/>bodies against all <del>profane</del> <lb/>fiction, <del>and especially if</del> <add>of a bold and</add> of a <lb/>passionate cast, it should <lb/>be observed, that the morality <lb/>of Poetry, like that of all other <lb/>influences affecting human conduct, <lb/>is precisely correspondent to the <lb/><del>nature</del> <add><unclear></unclear></add> of its cause. Of poetry <lb/>of a healthy kind, the moral effect <lb/>upon its readers will be healthy <lb/>also - <del>reciprocally so,</del> <add>and exalting it</add> or to that <lb/>degree in which its readers themselves <lb/>are as morally healthy. It is <lb/>objected, for instance, that Poetry <lb/>addresses itself chiefly to the <lb/>passions; - the significance of <pb facs="C386/0016.jpg"/> the term <hi rend="ul">passions</hi>, as here put, <lb/>including many of not all of <lb/>the moral sentiments. But to this <lb/>objection in its general scope, the <lb/>general <del>fact of things</del> <add><unclear></unclear>,</add> appends <lb/>a sufficient answer. The <lb/>passions and <hi rend="ul">sentiments</hi>, for their <lb/>unity is fundamental, are and ever <lb/>will be, the moving elements of <lb/>human life; and Morality, properly <lb/>so called, is just the systematised <lb/>experience of Reason &amp; Imagination <lb/>endeavouring conjointly to secure <lb/>the <hi rend="ul">best results</hi> from their sympathetic <lb/>and antipathetic activity. <del><unclear></unclear></del> <lb/>They consitute our social strength <lb/>as well as they facilitate our social <lb/>weakness. They beautify and elevate <lb/>as well as deform and debase our <lb/>moral character; and whatever <lb/>tends to dwarf or perish, or more <lb/>than wisely <hi rend="ul">direct</hi> them, tends <lb/>so far to <del>vitiate</del> <add>perish &amp; dispel</add> it, by narrowing <pb facs="C386/0017.jpg"/> and nullifying in its subjects <lb/>the scope and royalty of Reason. <lb/>And if this statement of the <lb/>case be true, and I believe <lb/>there can be little rational <lb/>doubt that it is, the thousand <lb/>and one <hi rend="ul">religious</hi> objections to <lb/>Poetry, as such or in the gross, <lb/>will eventually be current only <lb/>amongst the <del><unclear></unclear></del> <add>ignorant</add> congregations <lb/>of obscure conventicles, and <lb/>philosophically respectable in the <lb/>eyes of a few puritanical divines <lb/><del>and begotted declamimers.</del> <add><unclear></unclear></add></p>

<p>As to the cavils of those utilitarian <lb/><hi rend="ul">animals</hi> who are in the bad habit <lb/>of decrying Poetry as an idle and <lb/>unnatural art, and its <unclear></unclear> <lb/>as worse than useless - <hi rend="ul">their</hi> <lb/>cavils, I would say, are utterly <lb/>unworthy of the serious notice of <lb/>any <del>comprehensively</del> <add><unclear></unclear></add> intellectual <pb facs="C386/0018.jpg"/> man, even though he were but <lb/><del>lecturing upon the beauties</del> <add>defending</add> of a <lb/>rhymed Treatise upon Kitchen <lb/>Gardening, <add>a dwarf Epic <del n="1">about</del> in <unclear></unclear></add> or Cobbett's Corn <del n="2">! <lb/>How then in my present position, <lb/>can I <del n="3"><unclear></unclear></del> so myuch as mentally recognise <lb/>them?!</del> My only <add>other</add> feeling with regard <lb/>not at all/ is one of mere wonder; -<lb/>that Nature, herself a poet, should <lb/>have stooped to produce them. For <lb/><add><unclear></unclear> <lb/></add> <lb/>so far from Poetry being an <lb/>unnatural form of eloquence, <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> it is the natural language of <lb/>natural man; and it <add>is</add> only after he <lb/>has become a mere business <lb/>machine, - a mere creature of <lb/>Trade, that he descends to what <lb/>is called <add>, - and well called,</add> <del><unclear></unclear></del> plodding prose.</p>

<p>"Were it modest (says Steel) I <lb/>should profess myself a great admirer <pb facs="C386/0019.jpg"/> of Poesy. But that profession <lb/>is, in effect, to tell the world that <lb/>I have a heart tender and generous; <lb/>a heart that can swell with the <lb/>joys or be depressed with the <del><unclear></unclear></del> <lb/>misfortunes of others; - nay more, <lb/>even of imaginary persons: a <lb/>heart large enough to receive <lb/>the greatest ideas <del>of</del> Nature <lb/>can suggest, and delicate enough <lb/>to relish the most-beautiful. <lb/>It is desiring mankind to <lb/>believe that I am capable <lb/>of entering into all those <unclear>subtle</unclear> <lb/>graces, and all that divine <lb/>elegance, the enjoyment of <unclear>which</unclear> <lb/>is to be felt only, and not <lb/>expressed."</p>

<p>"Poetry (says Shelley) lifts the <lb/>veil from the hidden beauty of <lb/>the world, and makes familiar <lb/>objects be as if they were not <pb facs="C386/0020.jpg"/> familiar. It reproduces all that <lb/>it represents; and the impersonations <lb/>clothed in its Elysian light stand <lb/>thenceforth in the minds of those <lb/>who have once contemplated <lb/>them, as memorials of that <lb/>gentle and exalted content which <lb/>extends itself over all thoughts <lb/>and actions with which it co-exists. <lb/>The great secret of morals is love, <lb/>or a going out of our own nature, <lb/>and an identification of ourselves <lb/>with the beautiful which exists <lb/>in thought, action, or person not our <lb/>own. A man, to be greatly <lb/>good, must imagine intensely <lb/>and comprehensively; he must <lb/>put himself in the place of another, <lb/>and of many others: the pains <lb/>and pleasures of his species must <lb/>become his own. The great <lb/>instrument of moral good is <pb facs="C386/0021.jpg"/> imagination; and poetry <lb/>administers to the effect by acting <lb/>upon the cause."</p>

<p>In fine, Poetry, - to define it <lb/>specifically, - <del>in its primordial <lb/>sentiment</del>, is the harmonised <lb/>expression in language of a fine <lb/>feeling of the beautiful or pathetic, <lb/>and of the sublime or commanding <lb/>in any thing and <add>in</add> all things. But <lb/>its destiny as an Art, is only <lb/>thoroughly fulfilled when it is carried <lb/>beyond this its mere specific nature, <lb/>into the service and championship <lb/>of Truth: and then indeed, it is the <lb/>chief of the Humanities.</p>

<p><del n="1">But</del> If <del n="2">then</del> Poetry there <del n="3">be</del> <add><unclear></unclear></add> not <lb/><add>to</add> Truth, though in a peculiar and <lb/>figurative <del>form</del> <add>manner</add>, away with it! <lb/><del>Away with it, I say!</del> for this <lb/>planet, in this nineteenth century, <lb/>should have no place for an <lb/>idler. The Poet who, in these <lb/>days, regards his art as merely <pb facs="C386/0022.jpg"/> amusive, is either unaware of its <lb/>oracular character, or he is unfaithful <lb/>to his mission. He may be, upon <lb/>the whole, a "very pretty poet," but <lb/>he will do little or nothing worthy <lb/>of remembrance for Poetry; which <lb/>should be as much the expression <lb/>in its spirit of the moral and <lb/>mental pressure of its age as <lb/>prose. The Ideal and the <lb/>Unreal are in nowise the same; <lb/><del>though the prosaic, in their mental <lb/>proneness, may confound the <lb/>one with the other, and esteem <add>themselves</add> <lb/>win in doing so - yea, superlatively <lb/>wise! But let them not be imitated <lb/>in this by the comprehensively</del> intellectual. <lb/>Whatever moves us, however intangible <lb/>and <unclear>viewless</unclear> in itself, is <add>in a very <unclear></unclear> sense</add> <hi rend="ul">real</hi>; and <lb/>whatever does so to a good end, <lb/>is of the nature of Truth. An <lb/>impalpable thought is an actual <lb/>as a star, and may have as certain <lb/>a sphere in the moral world <pb facs="C386/0023.jpg"/> as that has in the physical.</p>

<p>The moderns have <del>too</del> little <lb/>faith in the Ideal, <del>as</del> <add>yet is it</add> the beauteous <lb/>love-birth of the soul in fruition <lb/>with its empyreal affinities; - <del>as</del> a <lb/>spiritual insight, however imperfect <lb/>of the Yet-to-be or of the unfulfilled: <lb/>and <del>as</del> <add>a</add> promissory evidence also of <lb/>the Godward ascension and <lb/>immortality of <del>Mind</del> <add>the sinful</add>. With the <lb/>ancients, on the contrary, Poesy and <lb/>Prophecy were one; and their mythical <lb/>Deities were so far Realitites as they <lb/>were mental impersonations of the <lb/><add>Energies and</add> <unclear></unclear> of Nature. Hence they <lb/>believed in their poetry. It was only <lb/>a more harmonious and figurative <lb/>mediums than their prose for the <lb/>voices and types of their religion <lb/>and philosophy, as well as of their <lb/>joys and sorrows, their loves and <lb/>wars: and the poetical disbelief <lb/>of the moderns is peculiarly <lb/><hi rend="ul">modern</hi>. It comes, however, <lb/>by cause, as Polonoius would say; <pb facs="C386/0024.jpg"/> being traceable, with the terms which <lb/>indicate it, "mere poetry", to the <lb/>fact of certain Mythologies which <lb/>were alone proper to the ages of <lb/>their creation, having been imitatively <lb/>adhered to in subsequent ones, to <lb/>which they were becoming or had <lb/>become already "creeds outworn."</p>

<p>Still there was enough in the <lb/>poetry of the most mythological <lb/>eras, to show, by its agreement with <lb/>the ideal spirit of all succeeding <lb/>time, how inherently plastic, and thence <lb/>progressive, in its nature, was the <lb/>faculty that fashioned it. And <lb/>"upon this hint" the greater moderns <lb/>began to apply it more and more, like <lb/>Milton and Dante, to the imaginative <lb/>demands of their own generations. <del>A</del> <lb/>A striking developement of the faculty <lb/>in these regards, has signalised the present <lb/>century, even to the extent of founding <lb/>a school of what may be specifically <lb/>called the Poetry of Progress: and <del>I</del> <ref target="C386-0024">*</ref> <pb facs="C386/0025.jpg"/> think it may be safely concluded, <lb/>that Poetry henceforth will more &amp; <lb/>more approve itself a meet and <lb/>harmonious organ for the utterance <lb/>of all manner of moral truth <add>as well as of exquisite feeling and beautiful thought</add>; tell <lb/>it again command, though on new <lb/>grounds, that popular belief in its <lb/>divinity which was the inspiration <lb/>of the poets of Greece and the prophets <lb/>of Israel.</p>

<p>Nor can the manner in which <lb/>the poets of Greece are here associated <lb/>with the prophets of Israel be fairly <lb/>objected to. Whether the prophets <lb/>spoken of were specially inspired by <lb/>God may be a question - but there <lb/>can be none of their having been <lb/>poets. Neither can there be any, <lb/>in the face of their writings of their <lb/>having been possessed with poetical genius <lb/>of the highest order - and such genius <lb/>is always prophetic. But, of itself, <lb/>it only <hi rend="ul">fortells</hi> because it <hi rend="ul">forefeels</hi>. <lb/>Ideality is the very organ of moral <pb facs="C386/0026.jpg"/> progress, and great poets, possessing <lb/>this pre-eminently, and speaking through <lb/>its divine instinct, but typify in <lb/>their visions the salvations it promises <lb/>to the future. Still <del>the burthen</del> <add>the <unclear></unclear> relaities</add> of <lb/>the Past and the Present, <del>wtih all</del> their <lb/>envyings, their faithlessness and bigotry, <lb/><del>is</del> <add>are</add> forever hanging over and darkening <lb/>around them; and they are thus disposed <lb/>to forebode some crowning martyrdom, <lb/>as the signal of the beginning of the <lb/>better time <del>coming, and as the final <lb/>sanction of the same.</del> The predicted <lb/>Redeemer must submit to death <add>for Truth's sake</add> &amp; <lb/>have victory over the grave. <del n="1">Hence <lb/>the recorded fulfilment - the cross -</del> <del n="2">the <unclear></unclear></del> <lb/><del>the resurrection</del> <add><unclear>passion</unclear> by the divinity of love.</add></p>

<p>I do not, however, dispute <lb/>the special illumination of the seers <lb/>of Israel. In addition to the <lb/>naturally prophetic light which I <lb/>suppose high poetical genius to be <lb/>gifted with, they may have been <lb/>divinely enlightened, and have <pb facs="C386/0027.jpg"/> actually foreseen in spirit as well <lb/>as forefelt constitutionally whatever <lb/>they predicted. <add>I will conclude this <lb/><unclear></unclear> of my subject</add></p>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>II. The second or middle <add>division</add> of my <lb/>subject, is the distinguishment of <lb/>the kinds of Poetry - chiefly the <lb/>Poetry of mere Talent <add>however cultivated</add> from that of <lb/>absolute Genius.</p>

<p>From the time of Dryden down very <lb/>nearly to the present century, the Poetry <lb/>of talent alone was generally appreciated <lb/>by the literati of England; and even yet <lb/>it is better relished by many highly <lb/>educated readers than the poetry of <lb/>genius: its specious pretense <add>external gaudiness</add>, and tinkling <lb/>epigrammatic finist, rendering it naturally <lb/>more agreeable to the habitual <lb/><unclear>insincerity</unclear> of the accomplished worldling, <lb/>and to the sprightly affectation, and <lb/>unmeaning, unearnest sentimentality <lb/>of the merely fashionable of both sexes. <lb/>But how shall I define, with the <pb facs="C386/0028.jpg"/> brevity suitable to this Discourse, <lb/>the distinction here [mooted]7. Of the <lb/>Poetry of Talent, I would say, that it <lb/>principally recommends itself by a certain <lb/>polished diffuseness of phrase, and an <lb/>ostentations affluence of outward <lb/>ornament: whilst the poetry of Genius, <lb/>with great apparant plainness perhaps, <lb/>depends almost as exclusively upon a <lb/>robust simplicity of diction, a nervous <lb/>sublimation of its material elements, <lb/>and the inward spells and pathos of a <lb/>far-thoughted Suggestiveness; - that the <lb/> first affects primarily the bodily attributes <lb/>of Beauty and Truth; the latter the <lb/>spiritual, esteeming the visible <del>fame</del> <add>phrases</add> <lb/>of things but as <del>the</del> external expressions <lb/>of <del>the</del> <add>a</add> deeper and lose-like prevalence <lb/><del>of there</del> <add>of their divinity.</add></p>

<p>In the merest objective description <lb/>- <del>is</del> the merest sketches of natural <lb/><add>scenery</add> this distinction of character is still <lb/>observable. Here also the poetry of talent <lb/>depends mainly upon superficial particularity <lb/>and mechanical finish, - smoothing <pb facs="C386/0029.jpg"/> up everything as with the plane <lb/>of a joiner. The poetry of Genius, <lb/>in the same department, is more <lb/>selective, yet more boldly and <lb/>strikingly accurate, giving by a few <lb/>faithful and earnest touches, in the <lb/>right leading order, a scenic <lb/>outline <del>that</del> <add>which</add> is at once duskily <lb/>definite and goldenly dreamy - like <lb/>that of a sunset prospect under <lb/>the God-fashioned pencil of Nature <lb/>herself: nor are the foregrounds <lb/>of the picture less sufficingly, though <lb/>not minutely indicated; while as a <lb/>whole it is pervaded by a sensational <lb/>quietude, resulting from <del>the</del> <add>a</add> pro- <lb/>-found reality of <del>its</del> communion <lb/>with the sublime and the Beautiful. <lb/>The poetry of mere talent, on the <lb/>other hand, would compensate <lb/>for a conscious want of this ideal <lb/>wealth and this truthful repose, <lb/>by a fanciful brightness of conceit <pb facs="C386/000030.jpg"/> and allusion, and by that steamy <lb/>sort of <del>exert most</del> enthusiasm, which, <lb/>in order to sustain itself at the given <lb/>attitude, and excite the reader as well, <lb/>has nothing for it, but to resort to <lb/>exclamatory flourishes.</p>

<p>To illustrate, by way of example, <lb/>the difference here attempted to be defined, <lb/>take the following passage from Darwin <lb/>as a striking general specimen of the <lb/>kind first mentioned - the poetry <lb/>of Talent.</p>

<p>The line from Collins are transcendently <lb/>above all cavil. They are perfect in every <lb/>respect, - in harmony, coloring, imagery, <lb/>order of circumstances, and language <lb/>or fulness and fitness of expression. <lb/>And not only do they lovingly embody <lb/>a faultless picture of the actual in <lb/>one of its "happiest attitude", but with <lb/>a creative intensity, earnest even as the <lb/>creativeness of Nature herself, they <lb/>impersonate beside the very Spirit of <lb/>the season, and bring into the visible <lb/>scene, or evoke out of its objects, that <lb/>fine-felt intination of the Ideal which <lb/>is requisite to the entire satisfaction <lb/>of our poetical faculty. Still in this <lb/>creativeness, Collins is simply mythical <lb/>after the instinct of Genius - not <lb/>obviously figurative <del>after</del> according <lb/>to the ruke and method of mere Talent.</p>

<p>Very inferior in comparison <lb/>is the passage from Byron. Its <lb/>prime, though least obvious defect, <pb facs="C386/0035.jpg"/> is the circumstantial confounding <lb/>together of the visible attributes of <lb/>of Evening and Early Night. But <lb/>it is very defective in several other <lb/>respects. The expression "from <lb/>the boughs" in the first line is at <lb/>once vague and common-place. <lb/>Then "lovers' vows <hi rend="ul">seeming</hi> sweet <lb/>in every whispered word" is namby- <lb/>pambyish at best; and what follows <lb/>in the fifth and sixth lines as <lb/>meaningless as may be:</p>

<p><q>- gentle winds and waters near <lb/>Make music to the lonely ear.</q></p>

<p>Whoae or what ear? A lonely grimal- <lb/>-kin's or a lonely lover's? From <lb/>what ensues in the text of the poem <lb/>whence the lines are taken, we find, <lb/>it is true, that Parasina's or Hugo's <lb/><hi rend="ul">may</hi> be intended; but the description <lb/>is notwithstanding so far a general <lb/>one as to cut it off from any <lb/>valid excuse derivable from that <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> circumstances. Now the <lb/>ear of Loneliness would be <pb facs="C386/0036.jpg"/> figurative at all events - but <hi rend="ul">ness</hi> <lb/>does not rhyme to <hi rend="ul">ear</hi> and <hi rend="ul">near</hi> <lb/>does: though as to waters being near <lb/>or otherwise (giving the winds in to <lb/>be made the most of) - <hi rend="ul">that</hi>, I <lb/>suspect, will always, even in poetry, <lb/>depend a trifle more upon <hi rend="ul">the place</hi> <lb/>than <hi rend="ul">the hour</hi>. Thenceforth, however, <lb/>it must be admitted, the the passage <lb/>improves mightily - nay, deepens <lb/>into absolute beauty: though "clear <lb/>obscure" and "softly dark", and <hi rend="ul">darkly</hi> <lb/>pure" are little more than one idea <lb/>diluted into a trinity of phrases. <lb/>For there can be no doubt that whatever <lb/>is clearly obscure must be darkly pure <lb/>as well. In excuse, however, for <lb/>thus much of repetition, the impera- <lb/>-tiveness of rhyme might be pleaded; <lb/>but then we have "softly dark" also, <lb/>thrust in between, - softness in <lb/>darkness implying, if it does not <lb/>express, nearly, if not exactly <lb/>the same thing: that is to say, a <pb facs="C386/0037.jpg"/> visible clearness or purity of <lb/>medium. But the closing line of <lb/>the passage is eminently beautiful <lb/>and suggestive, and almost carries <lb/>the whole description along with it <lb/>into the region of Genius. <hi rend="ul">Twilight <lb/>melting beneath the moon away</hi>, - as a <lb/>pictorial seizure of a most-elusive <lb/>scenic event, is nearly upon a par <lb/>with the <hi rend="ul">gradual dusky veil</hi> of <lb/>Collins.</p>

<p>Thus in the description of <lb/>natural appearances especially, the <lb/>poetry of absolute genius never descends <lb/>to the false - but, content with its own <lb/>and Nature's virtual lustre, it avoids, <lb/>as with instinctive contempt, the mere <lb/>tinsel of artistic Talent. Hence it never <lb/>presents us with the merely sparkling for <lb/>the subtle radiance of the purely beautiful; <lb/>or the speciously declamatory for the truly <lb/>sublime; or conceit and affectation <lb/>for simplicity and pathos. In final <lb/>proof of this, let us contrast a night <lb/>description of Pope (from Homer) <pb facs="C386/0038.jpg"/> with a similar passage by Milton. <lb/>Here are the lines from Pope.</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l>As when the Moon, <unclear>refululgent</unclear> lamp of Night,</l>
<l>O'er heaven's clear azure spreads her sacred light,</l>
<l>When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,</l>
<l>And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene;</l>
<l>Around her throne the vivid planets roll,</l>
<l>And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole;</l>
<l>O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure <del>spread</del> shed,</l>
<l>And tip with silver every mountain's head:</l>
<l>Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,</l>
<l>And floods of glory burst from all the skies.</l>
</lg></q>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>Having <del>heard</del> perused them attentively, <lb/>let us proceed to examine <del>it</del> <add>them</add> critically - with <lb/>honest severity of judgment: not hypercritically, <lb/>though with a searching minuteness. The <lb/>first four lines are good, though even in <lb/>them the language is somewhat diffuse, <lb/>and the images too vague and general. -<lb/><del>insomuch so</del> <add>so vague and general indeed</add>, that the whole picture <lb/>they would <del>embody</del> <add>present us</add> floats off with <lb/>the sound <add>or the verse</add> like a liberated gossamer. <lb/>The fifth line conveys a poetical <lb/>common-place at best; and the sixth <lb/>is positively bad, - the expression "gild", <lb/>as applied to the <del><unclear></unclear></del> pole, being mean <pb facs="C386/0039.jpg"/> and mechanical, and the epithet "glowing", <lb/>which follows, a pleonasm. The stars <lb/>are said <hi rend="ul">to gild</hi> what they had already <lb/>made <hi rend="ul">to glow</hi> - the pole <hi rend="ul">of itself</hi> not being <lb/>luminous. The description which ensues <lb/>in the sixth and eighth lines is strikingly <lb/>false. The rays of the stars do never <lb/>sensibly yellow the verdure of the dark <lb/>trees after the moon has "spread her <lb/>sacred light" over the heavens; the reflexion <lb/>of <hi rend="ul">their</hi> light being then, except on smooth <lb/>water, apparently lost in hers. Then the <lb/>term "tip" in such a place is paltry. We <lb/>might very properly talk of the head of <lb/>a walking cane being tipped with silver <lb/>- such a cane, for instance, as Sir Plume <lb/>in the Rape of the Lock, was so justly <lb/>proud of; but to describe the moonlight <lb/>(though of the <del><unclear></unclear></del> grammatical construction <lb/>of the passage <hi rend="ul">it is the starlight</hi>) as <hi rend="ul">tipping</hi> <lb/>the <add>great grand</add> head of a mountain - verily, I say, <lb/><hi rend="ul">that</hi> is ridiculous. <add>In Popes case of it in the passage before us</add> It is a reduction <lb/>of the mighty features of Nature upon the <lb/>mannikin principles of miniature. <lb/>The poet who could so write, could never <lb/>have seen a mountain by moonlight <pb facs="C386/0040.jpg"/>otherwise than through the "spectacles <lb/>of books." The only really fine and truthful <lb/>line in the passage, the last but one, is <lb/>damnified neverthless by its connection <lb/>with the last, the imagery of which, in sofar <lb/>as it conveys any positive meaning at all, <lb/>being <del>tautological</del> outrageously tautological <lb/>throughout.</p>

<p>Now by way of contrast, let us <lb/>attend to the divine Milton on a <lb/><del n="1">similar subject, - laying our heads <lb/>for the occasion, with the open faith of <lb/>children (if I may be allowed the figure) <lb/>in the very loving lap of thanaca.</del></p>

<p>Here everything is destined, and <del>gloriously</del> <add>glowingly</add> <lb/>suggestive. The whole scene unbrokenly glasses <pb facs="C386/0041.jpg"/>itself in the reader's imagination, <lb/>in the period of its happiest quietude - <lb/>even as unbrokenly as the twilight heavens, <lb/><del>and</del> <add>with</add> the earliest stars, and the dusking mountain <lb/>shores, are beheld in the gleaming mirror <lb/>of some waveless lake, - idealising its depths, <lb/>and thereby suggesting a reach and compass <lb/>of ethereal beautym transcending even that <lb/>of the realities above and around them. <lb/>And this idealising suggestiveness is the <del><unclear></unclear></del> <add>inmist</add> <lb/>test of the poetry of genius, and the final <lb/>contradistinguishment of it from the poetry <lb/>of mere Talent, however good otherwise. <lb/><del>Hence</del>, In Pope's picture (for it is not <lb/>Homer's) the wholeness of Nature is confused <add>broken up and</add> <lb/>into bright but fallacious particulars; whilst <lb/>in Milton's, the particulars <add>themselves</add> are but the several <lb/>truths of her magnificent unity.</p>

<p>Had Pope paraphrased Milton, as <lb/>he did Homer we should have had <lb/>this transcendent passage <add>(<unclear></unclear> use a publishable word)</add> <hi rend="ul">transmogrified</hi> <lb/>somewhat as follows - if indeed <lb/>he would have retained even so much <lb/>of its native pith and freshness, or <lb/>have substituted any thing so <pb facs="C386/0042.jpg"/> figuratively pictorial as the matter <lb/>of the tenth line, or have contrived, <lb/>as I have done, to leave the last <lb/><del>almost</del> wholly unshorn of the silver <lb/>fleece of its <add>simple and</add> pristine beauty.</p>

<p>And here, I would ask by the way, <lb/>with regard to the true music of verse, what <lb/>have we in comparison? Certainly the <lb/>measures of the paraphrase may be more <lb/>manageable by an ordinary tongue, more obvious <lb/>to an unpractised eye, and earlier appreciated <lb/>by a common-place ear - but still, in artistic <pb facs="C386/0043.jpg"/> competition with the original, they are <lb/>only, as it were, the cut up tinkling of a <lb/>piano, to the continuous and many-toned <lb/>warble of an organ. - But are we to <lb/>have no relish for Pope, because his ideal <lb/>and harmonic perceptions and impressions <lb/>were less truthful and strenuous than those <lb/>of Milton? Or because the poetical spirit <lb/>of the one was "like a star and dwelt apart," <lb/>are are to have no admiration for the <lb/>chandelier-like brilliancy of the other's? On <lb/>the contrary, our sympathy with the Beautiful <lb/>should be as catholic as possible: but judicious <lb/>withal and ascending. We should know that <lb/>Poesy has several heavens, all more or less <lb/>delightful; but we should know at the <lb/>same time, that only one of these, - the <lb/>highest, - in the abode of the Seraphim.</p>

<p>With an eye to the difference of kind <lb/>here mooted, <del>let</del> the poetical student <lb/><add>may</add> compare throughout the writings of <lb/>Moore, as of the highest order of the <lb/>poetry of Talent, having not unfrequently <lb/>a fiery flush of something surpassing <lb/>it, with those of Keats, as distinctively <lb/>of the poetry of genius: I mean in their <pb facs="C386/0044.jpg"/> spirit, for in form they are often somewhat <lb/>defective. This difference may be also <lb/>very clearly discerned by trying the poetry <lb/>of Shelley against Sir Walter Scott's; or the <lb/>poetry of Coleridge against that of Akenside <lb/>or of Rogers; or the poems of Thomson (though <lb/>ambitiously blazz to their detriment) against <lb/>the poems of Pope: whilst Dryden and Byron <lb/>may be consulted, <del>has</del> <add>as</add> having written in <lb/>both kinds, - in the first from their native <lb/>bent, but in the last only imitatively, however <lb/>happily; that is to say, after some model <lb/>either suggested or afforded by their subjects. <lb/>Grey's poetry is specifically of neither <lb/>kind, but displays a continuous mixture <lb/>of both in nearly equal <add><unclear></unclear></add> positions. The same <lb/>mixture of kind is observable in that of <lb/>Collins, but with genius more decidedly <lb/>predominent. Even the <del>poetry</del> <add>poems</add> of <lb/>Campbell, being with all their excellence <lb/>a wanting in richness, should be classed, <lb/>I think, as belonging upon the whole to the <lb/>Poetry of Talent; whilst those of Leigh <lb/>Hunt, and of Thomas Hood (when serious <lb/>will arrange as distinctively, in the main, <pb facs="C386/0045.jpg"/> under the higher head of the poetry <lb/>of Genius. Under the latter head also, <lb/>the whole body, vast as it is, of Wordsworth's <lb/>writings, is distinctly arrangeable <add n="1">notwithstanding this <unclear></unclear> human reference, and the absence in <del>it</del> <add n="2">them</add> of all machinery:</add>; whilst <lb/>for the most unmistakeable examples <lb/>of the species first mentioned <add>the <unclear></unclear> of intent</add>, in its <lb/>merest and most specific identity, the <lb/>metrical pieces of Addison and of Darwin <lb/>may be instanced <hi rend="ul">in toto</hi>. From what I <lb/>have seen of Tennyson's poetry I should <lb/>be inclined to class it under the head of <lb/>Genius; esteeming it, however, either too <lb/>microscopic, (so to speak) or, in the other <lb/>extreme, too indefinte: that is to say, <lb/>his pictures are too much made up of <lb/>minute details, without breadth and <lb/>continuity of outline; or they are of a <lb/>consistence so thin and subtle as to present <lb/>us with no definite outline at all. <lb/>On the other hand, the poetry of Bulwar, <lb/>though <del>possessing</del> <add>impressed with</add> the constitutional fervour <lb/>or mere temperament of genius, is very <lb/>distinctively assigneable to Talent only - <lb/>being indeed for the most part, but a robus- <lb/>-tous blaze of words, and  <unclear></unclear> deficient <lb/>of that intuitive logic, which is the <pb facs="C386/0046.jpg"/> peculiar dsafeguard of true poetical <lb/>genius against all that is false, or specious, <lb/>or merely conventional. In this classi- <lb/>fication, I can say nothing of that small- <lb/>-featured Haines-Bayleyish sort of poetry, <lb/>which, to be read appropriately, should be <lb/>read with a lisp; because it is not born <lb/>of the understanding at all, but of a <lb/>fulsome sentimentality that might exist <lb/>in a semi-idiot.</p>

<p>Finally, contrast the pastorals of Pope <lb/>and his imitators with the native songs <lb/>of Burns, the rural pieces of Milton, <lb/>and the Music's Duel of Crashaw: much <lb/>defect of form in the last poem, having <lb/>however, to be first admitted. And whilst <lb/>making these comparisons as to kind, <lb/>let the reader carry along with him the <lb/>following remarks, as a sort of general <lb/>key; namely, that the poetry of high talent <lb/>(only) has mostly more of artistic elegance <lb/>than of ideal beauty, and more of fanciful <lb/>admiration than of passionate love; whilst <lb/>the poetry of even moderate genius will often <lb/>evince a brave neglect of mere art, for the <lb/>sake of a certain natural simplicity, and <pb facs="C386/0047.jpg"/> is apt to forget (openly at least) to <lb/>admire, because of the quietly solemn, <lb/>or intensely earnest and absorbing quality <lb/>of its love: or to turn the purport of <lb/>the remark from the difference in question <lb/>to its constitutional origin, - Talent is <lb/>rather skilful than gifted, and draws <lb/>its enthusiasm chiefly from admiration; <lb/>Genius, on the other hand, trusts more to <lb/>nature than to art, and is strictly a <lb/>lover of the Beautiful, and not merely <lb/>or conventionally an admirer.</p>

<p>Through a perception of the difference <lb/>which I have thus far endeavoured to <lb/>explicate, Dr. Channing observes of the <lb/>writings of Milton, that "they bear the <lb/>impress of that seal by which genius <lb/>distinguishes its productions from works <lb/>of learning and taste. The great and <lb/>decisive test of Genius, is, that it calls <lb/>forth power in the souls of others. It <lb/>not merely gives knowledge, but breathes <lb/>energy. +++ We discern more clearly, <lb/>not merely because a new light is <pb facs="C386/0048.jpg"/> thrown over objects, but because our <lb/>vision is strengthened. Sometimes a <lb/>single word spoken by the voice of <lb/>genius goes for into the heart. A hint, <lb/>a suggestion, an undefined delicacy of <lb/>expression, teaches more than we gather <lb/>from volumes of less gifted men." <ref target="C386-0048">*</ref>

<p>III. <del>In the</del> <add>This brings me to the</add> third and last division <lb/>of my subject, <del>I have</del> <add>which is</add> to treat of versi- <lb/>-fication, as being the form in which <lb/>the poetical spirit has commonly chosen <lb/>to embody itself.</p>

<p>I design, in the first place to remark <lb/>at some length upon Heroic verse and upon <lb/>the couplet in particular; and then to add <lb/>such other observation upon versification <lb/>in general as may be conveniently comprised <lb/>within the limits of a lecture, already growing <lb/>perhaps to an unreasonable length.</p>

<p>I am afraid that ordinary readers <lb/>are nearly incapable, without much <lb/>previous discipline, of a nice appreciation <lb/>of a various verbal harmony. With regard <lb/>to heroic verse in particular, Pope and <pb facs="C386/0049.jpg"/> and his imitators seem to me to have <lb/>Frenchified and impoverished the <lb/>popular English ear to a deplorable <lb/>extent. How few, even amongst <lb/>scholars, have yet thoroughly liberated <lb/>their organ of tune (to speak phrenologically) <lb/>from an exclusive relish for that sliced <lb/>kind of line which runs its given <lb/>length and snaps short in the rhyme, <lb/>with the methodical pace and monotonous <lb/>clink of a weaver's shuttle: as in <lb/>the following example from Pope. He <lb/>is speaking of the operant power of <lb/>the Deity, which</p>


<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l>Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,</l>
<l>Glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees;</l>
<l>Lives through all life, extends through all extent,</l>
<l>Spreads, undivided, operared unspent.</l>
</lg></q>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>The sea-saw balance of the <lb/>pauses in these lines must be obvious <lb/>to every one. The last line in par- <lb/>-ticular, is halved as by a pair of <lb/>metrical compasses:</p>

<q><p>Spreads undivided, operares unspent.</p></q>

<p>I am aware, however, that much <del>stretch</del> <add>stress</add> <pb facs="C386/0050.jpg"/> has been laid upon the happy effect of <lb/>the semi-pauses which are thrown upon <lb/>the first word in each of the lines, but <lb/>that is mere metre-morefering to the extent <lb/>of nonsense; - a refinement as mecha- <lb/>-nical as wire-drawing. I am aware <lb/>also, that it has been alleged of these <lb/>same verses, that they possess a peculiar <lb/>propriety of structure on the score of <lb/>subject, and in the place where they occur. <lb/>To this it is not my design to object. I <lb/>only introduce them as a striking specimen <lb/>of <add>these</add> species. But even with regard to this <lb/>alleged propriety, it is very questionable, <lb/>whether such a super-precise slicing up <lb/>and weighing out of the Divine operancy, <lb/>is as proper to Poetry as it might be <lb/>Rhetoric.</p>

<p>But take another passage from the <lb/>same Writer, in which, though the pauses <lb/>are less rigidly distributed, the general <lb/>harmony is even more monotonous.</p>

<q><p>"Untwisting all the chains that tie <lb/>The hidden soul of harmony,"</p></q>

<p>and anon pouring over with the leaping <lb/>and redundant vigor of a waterfal! <lb/>How different, and at the same time how <lb/>superior us even the versification of <lb/>old Chaucer, whenever, amid all the <lb/>mutation which the language has since <del>,</del> <lb/>undergone, we can effectually restore it <lb/>to its original integrity: as in the following <lb/>example of his mastery in that respect. <lb/>He is describing a barn-door cock: which, <lb/>by the way, your thorough-paced <lb/>artificialist would denounce as a <lb/>subject too vulgar for poetry - too common <lb/>-place. Now nothing is either <del>too</del> vulgar <lb/>or common-place in a right poetical <lb/>sense which is beautiful as well as <lb/>natural. Nay, the most sublime and <lb/>beautiful objects in the universe, are <pb facs="C386/0052.jpg"/> at the same time the most common, <lb/>the most beholdable by all: - the daily <lb/>sun with his morning and evening pomp <lb/>of clouds - the nightly moon with her <lb/>starry equipage. The beauty of the <lb/>everlasting hills and eternal rivers is <lb/>equally <hi rend="ul">common</hi> with that of the garden <lb/>brier; and the loves and joys and sorrows <lb/>which constitute, with this natural beauty <lb/>for their theatre, the poetry of human <lb/>life, are our <hi rend="ul">common</hi> heritage. I repeat <lb/>then, that nothing is properly unpoetical <lb/>which is beautiful in its kind, or but <lb/>relatively so in its degree, however <lb/>frequent or accessible - that is, <hi rend="ul">common</hi>. <lb/>But the lines from Chaucer, in addition <lb/>to the mastery displaced in their versification, <lb/>will make the conclusively manifest.</p>

<p>There is the hearty, various, and yet <pb facs="C386/0053.jpg"/> flowing music that "touched the <lb/>trembling ears" of Shakespear and the <lb/>children of English Song down even <lb/>to Dryden. With what a royal <lb/>grace of will, and bountiful <lb/>affluence of melody, does the olden <lb/>Poet commond his pauses to the <lb/>right and left through the whole <lb/>description. Every thing like a <lb/>precise metrical balance of parts <lb/>is absolutely avoided; and yet the <lb/>unexpected differences of cadence in <lb/>the parts, or numerical numbers, <lb/>conduce to ensure upon the whole both <lb/>a unity and completeness of cadence; <lb/>that is, a perfect harmony. Thus Chaucer <lb/>has given pomp and wealth to the <lb/>apparent lowliness and poverty of the <lb/>subject, by the fine march of his lines, <lb/>and the flowing richness of his accessory <lb/>allusions: <del>, which <unclear></unclear> in turn <lb/>a <unclear></unclear> affluence of languages</del>: even <lb/>as some princely Bridegroom of the lusty <lb/>olden time, might scatter his gold in <lb/>the great and affable joy of his heart, <lb/>amongst the rustic jubilants at his <pb facs="C386/0054.jpg"/> wedding. - <del n="1"><unclear></unclear></del> <add>We have only to</add> read Pope's lines <del n="2">again, <lb/>and result</del> <add n="1">after them, to see</add> how <del n="3">utterly in</del> <add n="2">leanly</add> harmonious they <lb/>are in comparison.</p>

<p>And here it should be observed, that <lb/>the monotonous balance of sound objected <lb/>to in Pope's style, not only infected the <lb/>heroic couplet of the period in which it <lb/>most flourished, but every other species <lb/>of verse. Even in the blank of Addison's <lb/>Cato the same up and down gallop is <lb/>kept time to with the miraculous exactitude <lb/>of a rope dancer.</p>

<p>On this head compare further the <lb/>peculiar sing-song of Pope with the nervous <lb/>variety of Churchill's heroic rhyme: as in <lb/>the following specemin.</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<p>As poetry these lines are evidently the <pb facs="C386/0055.jpg"/> offspring of Talent only. They have all <lb/>the obvious figurativeness and rhetorical <lb/>verbosity which specifically distinguish its <lb/>productions from the effusions of Genius. <lb/>But as Heroic Rhyme they are nevertheless <lb/>of the right English harmonic build.</p>

<p>On this head <add>let the student</add> compare likewise (at <lb/>leisure) the poetic style of Pope and <lb/>Dryden throughout: or Pope's general <lb/>style with himself as he appears in <lb/>the following verses - the only passage <lb/>of his that I can call to memory in <lb/>which the pauses are bravely varied.</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l>Who noble ends, by noble means, attains,</l>
<l>Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,</l>

<p>Now Pope himself, I doubt not, <lb/>regarded these <add>verses</add> as just so far <lb/>defected in harmony, as the peculiar <lb/>middle balance of the great mass <lb/>of his lines was sinned against <lb/>in their structure. It would have <lb/>been well, however, if he had been <lb/>a transgressor to the same tune even <lb/>twice or thrice in every page of his <pb facs="C386/0056.jpg"/>works. And recurring for a moment <lb/>to the second example cited from him, - <lb/>he would have postively shuddered, <lb/>I fancy, at the <del><unclear></unclear></del> bare proposal <lb/>of such an emendation in the flow of m<lb/>the last <del><unclear></unclear></del> line as the following</p>

<p>And licks the hand - <hi rend="ul">lifted</hi> to shed its blood.</p>

<p>And yet not only does the substitution of <lb/>"lifted" for "just raised" defeat the monotony <lb/>of the lines taken all together, but it intimates <lb/>more forceably, because more abruptly, the <lb/>nature of the act spoken of as impending.</p>

<p>If the student require further contrasts <lb/>on this head, he may consult the poems <lb/>of Pomfret, a contemporary of Pope. How <lb/>the latter could have become so confirmed <lb/>in <add>his</add> "millifluous monotony" in the very <lb/>birth presence of such flowing specimens <lb/>of a freer style as were therein <lb/>open to him is almost a wonder. <lb/>But it was the poetical mistake <lb/>of his times: insomuch, that even a <lb/>great critic in some other respects, - I <lb/>mean Dr Johnson, could perceive no higher <lb/>merit in the style of Pomfret's verses, than <pb facs="C386/0057.jpg"/> a "certain easy volubility". But a <lb/>single passage, like the following, <lb/>taken at random, will be conclusive <lb/>of the fact of its possessing a certain <lb/>musical freedom of a far higher <lb/>mood than was dreamt of in the Doctor's <lb/>poetical philosophy.</p>

<l>With concern like his did I review</l>

<p>Observe how that sin against mere <lb/>metre in the last line becomes a positive <lb/>merit, by securing through the medium <lb/>of an unexpected position, an encreaser <lb/>of emphasis to the participle "left":</p>

<p>Still of course the sin against metre, <hi rend="ul">as <lb/>such</hi>, does not constitute the merit; which <lb/>is the happy consequence of a certain <lb/>incorporation of the sound and sentiment <lb/>of the verse, and which would amount <pb facs="C386/0058.jpg"/> to the same thing, whether <add>it</add> were achieved <lb/>by an adherence to or by a transgression <lb/>of rules merely metrical.</p>

</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>In Grey's stanza the harmony is injured, <pb facs="C386/0059.jpg"/>both verbally and sentimentally, by the <lb/>smooth sameness of every line; whilst <lb/>in Wordsworths', if I mistake not, the <lb/>redundant leap of the exclamation in <lb/>the first, "snatching a grace beyond <lb/>the reach of art", and the opening fulness <lb/>of the last line, encrease the earnestness, <lb/>and even the sweetness of the entire stanza. <lb/>To test the matter in its effect, get <lb/>rid of the redundancy by substituting <lb/><hi rend="ul">wondrous</hi> for "marvellous" <add>in the first line</add>, and of the <lb/>opening repletion in the fourth, by writing <lb/><hi rend="ul">after</hi> in place of "following" - as I have <lb/>sometimes actually seen these very lines <lb/>disguised in quotation by finical <lb/>metre-mongers.</p>

<p>There is besides a fulness of flow, <lb/>- especially in heroic verse, which, whereever <lb/>it can be given without abruptness, <lb/>is alwats preferable to mere smoothness <lb/>or precision of metre, as working <lb/>out a more sonorous euphony. This <lb/>I think may be made sufficiently <lb/>apparent by pronouncing the word <lb/><hi rend="ul">towered</hi> in the following example <pb facs="C386/0060.jpg"/> as being of three syllables, instead of <lb/><hi rend="ul">one</hi>, according to the supposed demand <lb/>of the metre.</p>

<p><del>Here, however, before concluding this <lb/>part of my subject, I would remark, that</del> <add>Nevertheless it should be observed here, that</add> <lb/>for satire, Verses of Compliment, the Epitaph <lb/>and the Epigram, a nicely balanced kind <lb/>of line is perhaps the most suitable. <lb/>The last excellence of such productions <lb/>arises out of a polished likeness of <lb/>parts, terminating in <add n="1">a <unclear></unclear> limited <del n="1"><unclear></unclear></del></add> <del n="2">subjective</del> com- <add n="2">therefore <del n="3">the</del></add> <lb/>-pleteness: <del>hence</del> <add>and</add> such a form is most <lb/>proper to them, being most in concord <lb/>with their spirit.

<p><del>(Under the head of versification <lb/>in general, I have little <unclear></unclear></del> <add>On this head, I would only <unclear></unclear></add> <lb/>only to observe (in the first place) <lb/>that smoothness and sweetness, though <lb/>often included the one in the other, <lb/>and having a natural tendency <pb facs="C386/0066.jpg"/> to conjoin, are nevertheless, upon <lb/>occasion, very far from being identical <lb/>qualities: that is to say, a passage may <lb/>be strictly smooth without being equivalently <lb/>sweet, and on the contrary, perfectly sweet <lb/>though not exactly smooth. The verse of <lb/>Sir Walter Scott, for instance, obtrudes <lb/>abundant examples <del><unclear></unclear></del> of absolute <lb/>smoothness existing absently from <lb/>sweetness. On the other hand, the <lb/>versification of Coleridge is perfectly <lb/>sweet throughout, without being ever, <lb/>or rarely, correspondently smooth in <lb/>a merely metrical sense. The <lb/>following passage from each of these <lb/>authors, taken almost at random, are <lb/>examples in point. The first is <lb/>Scott's.</p>

<p>I will conclude this Lecture with <lb/>a few remarks upon that indiscriminate <lb/>practise amongst general readers, which <lb/>is so speciously implied by the phrase <lb/>Every one to his taste. Now the gain <lb/>or loss of progressive and permanent <lb/>delight which is involved in a truthful <lb/>or fallacious tendency of taste, is far <lb/>too great to leave it even a matter of <lb/>popular indifference. The verse we <lb/>contemplate a real beauty in poetry, <lb/>the more distinctly symmetrical and <pb facs="C386/0073.jpg"/> harmonious - the more a "joy for ever" <lb/>does it become; and the more also does <lb/>our own individual ideality grow up <lb/>and strengthen by the <del><unclear></unclear></del> exercise into <lb/>its destined completeness. A false one, <lb/>on the contrary, in its prolonged effect <lb/>(supposing it to be admired) either <lb/>confuses our ideal perception, or subjects <lb/>the judgment; - or it does both. The one <lb/>is star-like and immortal, being of <lb/>the nature of truth; the other <add>is</add> meteorus <lb/>and <del n="1">unwholesome</del> <add n="1">unpermanent</add> being <del n="2">unfixable</del> <add n="2"><unclear></unclear> fixture</add> and <lb/>erroneous <add>and the <unclear>mortal</unclear> and noxious</add>. Such then is but a fair <lb/>statement of the difference in poetry <lb/>(as in all fine art) that may reside <lb/>in the indiscriminate practise amongst <lb/>readers, which is both <del>implied</del> <add>indicated</add> and <lb/>advocated by the phrase Every one to <lb/>his taste. And <del>certainly</del> <add>surely</add> such a <lb/>difference is no trifling one: seeing <lb/>that those who begin their poetical <lb/>studies with the trumpery <lb/>productions of some popular <pb facs="C386/0074.jpg"/> rhymester, generall end there <lb/>in utter faithlessness as to the fact, <lb/>of Poetry having for its basis any <lb/>determinate and universal principles <lb/>at all.</p>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<note xml:id="C386-0074"><p>Between and subordinate to the <lb/>two primary kinds of poetry of which <lb/>I have hitherto treated, there is another <lb/>kind which, if written in the best manner, <lb/>may be written equally well by the man <lb/>of talent or the man of genius: because, <lb/>with appropriate feeling, the manner <lb/>of it is everything.

<div type="prose">
<head><del>The Poetry of the Household Affections.</del></head>

<p><del n="1">There is a kind of poetry which may <lb/>be defined as above, and which, if <lb/>written in the best manner, may be <lb/>written equally <add>well</add> by the man of taste or <lb/>talent <del n="2">or</del> as by the man of genius; because <lb/>with appropriate feeling, the manner <lb/>of it in everything.</del></p>

<p>And as to the manner: - in all poems <lb/>of a homely cast, the voice of the Muse <lb/>should be simply that of the heart's <lb/>pathos, as responded to by the imagination, <lb/>and measured by art into sweetness, - <lb/>yet not so strictly measured as to be <lb/>out of keeping with the spontaneous <lb/>earnestness of the feelings which call it <lb/>forth.</p>

<p>This principle in poetry may be <lb/>thus elucidated by comparative examples. <lb/>Suppose a Mother to have lost by death <lb/>her male child, and that a verse <lb/>expressive of the fact, and imploring <pb facs="C386/0076.jpg"/> our pity as well, is to be put into her <lb/>mouth. Now the stickler for stills in <lb/>all poetry, would require that it should <lb/>be swellingly phrased, somewhat as <lb/>follows</p>

<p>- Compassionate my sufferings! <lb/>Fate has deprived me of my infant son.</p>

<p>They on the other hand who think <lb/>with me, would rather that it should <lb/>be habitid in a less ostentatious garb, <lb/>somewhat after this fashion.</p>

<p>- O pity me! <lb/>For I have <hi rend="ul">lost</hi> my little boy.</p>

<p>In the first example we have, it is true, <lb/>the imposing figure of Fate, enacting <lb/>the part of an <unclear></unclear>; but all that <lb/>is more than compensated for by <lb/>the pathetic vagueness of the <lb/>latter, arising out of the word <lb/><hi rend="ul">lost</hi>; and this quality, in conjunction <lb/>with the naturalness of the appeal, <lb/>renders it more essentially, and <pb facs="C386/0077.jpg"/> at the same time more <hi rend="ul">humanly</hi> poetic.</p>

<p>But the sticklers for style-<unclear>slilts</unclear> - <lb/>inane verbosity! - in all kinds of poetry <lb/>will be sure to quarrel with <del>such a</del> <add>this</add> doctrine. <lb/>It<del>s</del> excludes all the false pomp of <lb/>measure - <del>the</del> <add>all that</add> vitious big-worded invertion, <lb/>which they consider proper to poetry, if <lb/>not poetry itself. But the fact is, <lb/>that Verse (not in this kind only, but in <lb/>every other) has no more right than <lb/>prose <add>has</add> to violate the natural order <lb/>of language <add>the prose</add>. Its license in this respect <lb/>extends, or should extend, no further <lb/>than to arrange it metrically; and a <lb/>poetical style that transgresses this <lb/>limit is so far vitious. <del><unclear></unclear></del> In short <lb/>good poetry is just good prose, as <lb/>far as composition is concerned, <lb/>measured <add n="1">and paused</add> into a linear <add n="2">stanzaic</add> or <del>a</del> <lb/>paragraphical consonance. Splendor <lb/>of passion, - picturesque suggestiveness, <lb/>- ideal intensity; - all that <lb/>constitutes its essential and <pb facs="C386/0078.jpg"/> distinguishing spirit, is so far independent <lb/>of even these forms <add>whatever</add>, as to declare them dispensible, <lb/>however exquisite in themselves. Nay <lb/>more: the virtual qualities of poetry <lb/>are often injured by the charms of metre, <lb/>beyond all the compensations derivable <lb/>from their graces however golden. Still <lb/>the wild gait of the Muse must, and <lb/>should be restricted to a verbal and <lb/>sentimental harmony; - and few <lb/>persons can be less generally disposed <lb/>to decry the genuine felicities of numbers <lb/>than myself, or more disposed to be <lb/>dissatisfied with any Poem in which <lb/>there is a paucity of wildly musical <lb/>lines, flowing full on and cascading <lb/>into one another, like natural waters <lb/>- not in mathematical parrallels, like <lb/>Dutch canals, varied only <add><del><unclear></unclear></del></add> varied <lb/>at all, by <add n="1"><del n="1">certain</del> pre-ordered</add> <unclear></unclear> <del n="2">at <unclear></unclear></del> <add n="2"><del n="3">given</del></add>. <lb/>inevitably occuring at <add>certain <del><unclear></unclear> given</del></add> angles.</p>

<head>Blank Verse.</head>

<p>In my ordinary bill of <lb/>poetical fare, - in common perhaps <lb/>with most readers, I prefer rhyme <lb/>to blank verse. Still I think the <lb/>latter affords greater advantages <lb/>to a just <del>poetical</del> <add>metrical</add> harmony. It <lb/>involves, no doubt, when freely written, <lb/>the "golden cadences" of a tuneful <lb/>style of line more streamingly, because <lb/>more naturally; and is open also to <lb/>a more strenuous organ-like majesty <lb/>of modulation, than the recurrent <lb/>check in the flow of a passage which <lb/>is occasioned by like endings, can <lb/>possibly permit. Those swelling <lb/>and falling prolongations of measure, <lb/>which may be aptly figures as musical <lb/>waves successively undulating along the <lb/>bright sea beaches of the Ideal, are <lb/>native only to prime <unclear>blant</unclear> verse. <lb/>Still it labors under peculiar dis- <pb facs="C386/0081.jpg"/> disadvantages. A poem in blank <lb/>verse, when written in the best lb/>manner, requires to be read fully as <lb/>well as it is written, to secure to its <lb/>numbers anything like their due <lb/>effect; - nay, to prevent them from <lb/>falling into confusion, and becoming <lb/>"like sweet bells jangled out of <lb/>time"! And what is more rare than <lb/>a good reader of elaborately modulated <lb/><add>blank</add> verse? or indeed of any kind of verse <lb/><del>the melody of <unclear></unclear></del> whereof the melody <lb/>is achieved through other than the <lb/>most obvious and ordinary cadences.</p>

<p>Still the eye of a musical-minded <lb/>reader, so far as he himself is <lb/>concerned, will sufficiently correct <lb/>any incapacity of voice and manner <lb/>- sufficiently at least to beget in <lb/>him a growing appreciation of the <lb/>marshalling harmonies of finely <lb/>constructed numbers when un- <pb facs="C386/0082.jpg"/> unshackled with rhyme; and <lb/>eventually, in most cases, a decided <lb/>relish for them. But there is a <lb/>precisely balanced kind of blank verse, <lb/>like Young's, for instance, or Addison's, <lb/>that is intolerably inharmonious to a <lb/>musical ear. It wants all the <lb/>compensation of rhyme, while lacking <lb/>at the same time all that variously <lb/>interflowing melody of cadence which <lb/>should be primarily distinctive of <lb/>unrhymed numbers, and which alone <lb/>constitutes their proper harmony. <lb/>There is also another species of blank <lb/>verse (like much of Byron's) that is <lb/>obnoxious in several respects to the <lb/>same objection: though in its linear <lb/>arrangement it may be adroit and <lb/>flowing enough, and, when at the <lb/>best, may somewhat <add>strive</add> by its eloquent <lb/>profuseness for the gradational defects <lb/>of the rhythm. And this last is the <pb facs="C386/0083.jpg"/> the kind most likely to be preferred <lb/>by a literary novice with an ordinary <lb/>musical instinct.</p>

<p>The blank verse of Milton cannot <lb/>be surpassed for variety of modulation. <lb/>But it is too artistically difficult to <lb/>be ever very popular: being, indeed, <lb/>so numerous, that it requires to be <lb/>studied, like complex music, ere all <lb/>its harmony can be arrived at <lb/>and adequately fulfilled. Who, for <lb/>instance, but a well-practised reader, <lb/>could trippingly evolve, yet so as to <lb/>distribute them perfectly, the <lb/>measures of a passage so variously <lb/>paused as the following, which I <lb/>take almost at random from <lb/>the Paradise Lost?</p>

<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l rend="indent">- The eagle and the stork</l>
<l>On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build./</l>
<l>Part loosely wing the region,/ part more wise</l>
<l>In common,/ ranged in figure,/ wedge their way/</l>

<pb facs="C386/0084.jpg"/>

<l>Intelligent of seasons,/ and set forth</l>
<l>Their aery caravans,/ high over seas</l>
<l>Flying,/ and over lands,/ with mutual wing</l>
<l>Easing their flight;/ so steers the prudent crane</l>
<l>Her annual voyage;/ borne of winds;/ the air</l>
<l>Floats as they pass,/ fawned with unnumbered plumes./</l>
</lg></q>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>Hence it is that so few persons <lb/>can read the blank verse of Milton with <lb/>absolute effect. - In fine, its only fault, <lb/>(if it be a fault) is, that the interflowing <lb/>measures of each rhythmically dependent <lb/>passage or series of lines, do not often <lb/>enough terminate in one unbroken <lb/>verse. And this defect has been <lb/>avoided, I think by both Cowper <lb/>and Wordsworth.</p>

<p>The blank verse of Thomson <lb/>is also of a high order in the main, <lb/>though somewhat laboriously mea- <lb/>-sured and structually vitious. <lb/>Akenside's, on the other hand, is too <lb/>slippingly even upon the whole (though <pb facs="C386/0085.jpg"/> at times exquisite), from the <lb/>cadence being over continuously <lb/>carried into the middle, or thereabout, ,lb/>of the successive lines; - with, it is <lb/>true, a not unfrequent stretch <lb/>so far beyond as to the seventh <lb/>syllable; by which, however, in his <lb/>case, - though it effects perhaps, <lb/>when well contrasted, the most <lb/>exquisite of all the cadential <lb/>interflows, - the general difference <lb/>as to time, the true scale of verse, <lb/>is not sufficiently distributed. <lb/>The following example from the <lb/>Pleasures of Imagination will <lb/>exemplify my meaning.</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l>Call now to mind what high capacious powers</l>
<l>Lie folded up in Man:/ how far beyond</l>
<l>The praise of mortals/ may the eternal growth</l>
<l>Of Nature to perfection half divine</l>
<l>Expand the <unclear></unclear> soul./ What pity then</l>
<l>Should Sloth's unkindly fogs depress to earth</l>
<l>Her tender blossom,/ choke the streams of life,</l>

<pb facs="C386/0086.jpg"/>

<l>And blast her spring!/ Far otherwise designed</l>
<l>Almighty wisdom;/ Nature's happy cares</l>
<l>The obedient heart for otherwise incline.</l>
<l>Witness the sprightly joy,/ when aught unknown</l>
<l>Strikes the quick sense,/ and wakes each active power</l>
<l>To brisker measures:/ witness the <del><unclear></unclear></del> neglect</l>
<l>Of all familiar prospects./</l>
</lg></q>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>Here it is evident that the <lb/>measures are not <add>successively</add> prolonged and varied <lb/>enough, by being occasionally run out <lb/>further, even to the eighth or ninth <lb/>syllable, and then not so far, or only to <lb/>the second or third. Nay for the sake <lb/>of giving additional emphasis to some <lb/>leading term in the same, the <lb/>cadential pause should be <lb/>occasionally located even upon the <lb/>first syllable, as in the following <lb/>instances from Milton.</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<p>Or to the same end, and to compass <lb/>as well nearly the whole round of <lb/>variety, a single line should be <lb/>sometimes separated into no less <lb/>than three harmonic members, as <lb/>in the following examples from <lb/>the same poet.</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<p>Or to carry both this distribution <lb/>of emphasis and the principle of <lb/>variety and the principle of <lb/>variety in uniformity to their uttermost <lb/>limits, a single blank line may <lb/>be paused even into four such <lb/>harmonic gradations, as in the <lb/>ensuing instance, also from <pb facs="C386/0088.jpg"/> Milton.</p>

<p>In the blank verse of Cowper, <lb/>while it is nearly as smooth as Akenside's, <lb/>the defect hereinbefore noticed <add>as obtaining in that of the <unclear></unclear> part</add> has been <lb/>studiously avoided: and Cowper's <lb/>blank verse is the model of Wordsworth's. <lb/>But there is nothing in the language, to <lb/>my thinking, finer than the blank style <lb/>of Shelley's Alastor. Taken paragraphically, <lb/>it is certainly somewhat has numerous <lb/>than that of the Paradise Lost; but <lb/>then it has every Miltonic variety <lb/>upon the whole: and this I venture <lb/>to consider an improvement. At all <lb/>events, such a style is so much the <lb/>more adroitly readable at sight, that <lb/>the harmonic difference is thereby <lb/><del>fully</del> <add>sufficiently</add> compensated. And hence the <lb/>Alastor is a poem that would <pb facs="C386/0090.jpg"/> be invaluable, though only <lb/>regarded as a most masterly <lb/>exemplar of unrhymed heroic <lb/>verse.</p>

<head>Honest Poverty.</head>

<p>A dishonest shame of <lb/>honest poverty is the all-perva- <lb/>-ding ignobility of the times. <lb/>Rather than be poor, men will <lb/>readily become any thing they should <lb/>not. Rather than be thought so, they <lb/>will lie; rather than appear so, from <lb/>their associations, they will abandon <lb/>their own blood; rather than live so, <lb/>they will swindle; and rather than <lb/>die so, they will die damned. Fools! <lb/>what fear they? Are they philosophers? <lb/>Socrates was poor. Are they poets? <lb/>Homer begged his bread, <hi rend="ul">being blind</hi>; and <lb/>Burns died, as the mighty Wordsworth <lb/>lives, an exciseman. And finally, <lb/>are they Christians? Their great and <pb facs="C386/0095.jpg"/> perfect-minded Master had not <lb/>where to lay his head! Shame them <lb/>upon this meanest of all the <lb/>manifestations of cowardise!</p>

<p>To give the sum of the whole <lb/>question in a word: wealth in <lb/>itself is only an honorable attribute <lb/>when it is the <hi rend="ul">uninherited</hi> fruit <lb/>(and therefore the evidence) of industry, <lb/>probity and skill; and poverty <lb/>only dishonorable to any, when it <lb/>manifestly proceeds from sloth and <lb/><unclear>irrectitude</unclear>.</p>

<p>Still I am not disposed to glorify <lb/>Poverty as a thing of itself - as a <lb/>condition of choice; or otherwise <lb/>than as the severest providential <lb/>ordeal of moral honesty. Alas! <lb/>in its worldly effect, it is the <lb/>gaunt parent of at least two <pb facs="C386/0096.jpg"/> thirds of the evil to which human <lb/>nature is liable in society. Hence, <lb/>in this aspect, Shelly has said of it, and <lb/>but too truthfully:</p>

<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l>Thou knowest what a thing is Poverty</l>
<l>Among the fallen on evil days:</l>
<l>'Tis crime and fear and infamy</l>
<l>And houseless Want in frozen ways</l>
<l>Wandering ungarmented, and Pain</l>
<l>And, worse than all, that inward stain</l>
<l><unclear>Fowl</unclear> self-contempt, which drowns in <del>tears</del> <add>sneers</add></l>
<l>Youth's star light smile, and makes it, tears</l>
<l>First like hot gall - then dry for ever!</l>
</lg></q>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>Nevertheless the poor man who <lb/>should be so morally faultless as <lb/>to have nothing else to be ashamed <lb/>of, were he yet ashamed of his <lb/>honest poverty, would be but a <lb/>pitiful poltroon after all!</p>

<p>But how, in a world so <lb/>plentiful as this, - how comes it <pb facs="C386/0097.jpg"/> that any honest man is <lb/>poor - that is to say, <hi rend="ul">destitute</hi>? <lb/>Had we but one grain of true <lb/>human brotherhood - of real <lb/>fraternity, to every two grains of <lb/>even our present pride and <lb/>selfishness, the word Poverty <lb/>could have no ordinary social <lb/>meaning amongst us. But <lb/>there is a better time coming <lb/>; - and after that, a better still; - <lb/>and a better - and a better.</p>

<p>I would add a few words <lb/>as the bitter product of personal <lb/>experience. The worst and <lb/>ugliest thing about Poverty <lb/>(however honest) is, that the <lb/>spirit of friendship is generally <lb/>scared away by it from amongst <lb/>all who are not equally its victims. <pb facs="C386/0098.jpg"/> Half a life-long fellowships utterly <lb/>vanish - cry Presto! and begone, at <lb/> <del><unclear></unclear></del> the bare suspicion of its presence. <lb/>Hence with what an emphasis me he <lb/>who is obviously destitute, ask with <lb/>the poet:</p>
</div>

<div type="poem">

<lg><l>And what is Friendship but a name,</l>
<l rend="indent">A charm that lulls to sleep;</l>
<l>A shade that follows Wealth and Fame -</l>
<l rend="indent">But leaves the wretch to weep?</l>

<div type="prose">
<head>Truth.</head>

<p>"What is Truth?" With a <lb/>mere lawyer it is just a good <lb/>face on the case in hand - and <lb/>nothing more; and with merely <lb/>professional disquisitionists <pb facs="C386/0100.jpg"/> of all kinds, it is the security only, <lb/>I am afraid, of a like predicament.</p>

<p>But "what is Truth?" said Pilate, <lb/>and would not wait for an answer": <lb/>and the same question is still propounded <lb/>all the world over, and the reply <lb/>evaded, chiefly for the reason, that this <lb/>is <del>not</del> <add>never</add> attempted to be given sententiously <lb/>enough, nor for the single purpose <lb/>of elucidating the nature of the <lb/>thing sought for - however <del><unclear></unclear></del> un- <lb/>-earnestly. I will therefore venture <lb/>upon a brief definition of Truth <lb/>as it exists essentially.</p>

<p>In the first place then, it is <lb/>nothing more nor less than the provi- <lb/>-dential <hi rend="ul">disign</hi> of the general and par- <lb/>-ticular laws of the Universe, as they <lb/>act upon and through <add>inert</add> matter, and <lb/>in and through the constitutions of <lb/>organic beings.</p>

<p>This is Physical Truth, or Truth <lb/>in its basis. And Moral Truth is a <lb/>superstructure upon this, demanding <pb facs="C386/0101.jpg"/> the agincy of rational creatures; <lb/>being their right perception and <lb/>availment of the operant fitness <lb/>of those laws, as they act together in <lb/>and upon all natural substances, <lb/>and thence upon and through themselves <lb/>in their relation thereto and to one <lb/>another, as being equally participant <lb/>in their beneficence and amenable <lb/>to their rigor; - "health, peace and <lb/>competence" being the reward of a <lb/>right insight and just application of <lb/>this wisdom of Nature. And hence <del>truth</del> <lb/>moral truthfulness and Peace are alone <lb/>at one. The truly moral man, by a <lb/>consequence flowing from the very <lb/>rectitude of his consciousness, and <lb/>despite the storms of Fortune, must <lb/>always possess an indeprivable <lb/>quitude, - a central calm, like that <lb/>which, in the midst of eternal agitation, <lb/>is forever <add>lying</add> at the heart of the world.</p>

<p>But what then is Error? It is <pb facs="C386/0102.jpg"/> nothing more nor less than the <lb/>misperception leading to misapplication <lb/>of the design of the laws thus tending, <lb/>under God, to develope the physical <lb/>and moral harmony of all things: <lb/>so that, apart from a freely intelligent <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> agent, like man, there were nothing <lb/>but fixed truth in the universe. Hence <lb/>the penal principle of our moral <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> probation is evidently founded <lb/>in our liberty to beget error, by being <lb/>neglectful of this righteousness of <lb/>Nature. And hence too, right-thinking <lb/>and rectitude of conduct (that is virtue) <lb/>are the prime ends of a moral being <lb/>such as man; and the consciousness of <lb/>having fulfilled <del>the</del> <add>these conditions</add>, must be also, <lb/>by logical consequence, his supreme <lb/>good or universal happiness. For <lb/>whether <del>they</del> <add>such a course</add> lead to <hi rend="ul">fortuitous success <lb/>or disaster</hi>, <del>the</del> <add n="1">the</add> consciousness <add n="2">thereof</add> is yet <lb/>finally consummate in itself, both <lb/>as to time and place; - is inevitably <lb/>self-centred, complete and <lb/>indeprivable.</p>

<pb facs="C386/0103.jpg"/>

<p>But the subject does not <lb/>terminate here. As moral is a <lb/>superstructure upon physical <lb/>truth, there is a superstructure <lb/>upon it also - namely Religious <lb/>Truth; indicated by a special mental <lb/>faculty in Man, and thence attestable <lb/>by its perfecting agreement with all <lb/>natural truth. Hence sin, properly <lb/>such, is, I conceive, our wilful <lb/>blindness to and perversion of <lb/>this spiritual and natural <lb/>consonance, and our failing <lb/>also to hallow all perfection <lb/>by referring it in worship to the <lb/>providential goodness and <lb/>almighty sanction of God.</p>

<p>In another view of the <lb/>whole subject, with reference to <lb/>the moral and religious agency <pb facs="C386/0104.jpg"/> of man, all kinds of truth may be <lb/>said to reside in the sum total of <lb/>things, as the powers of arithmatic <lb/>do in numbers: correct, - that is <lb/>rational principles being the rules <lb/>by which we ascertain their tendencies <lb/>and establish the facts of their <lb/>results. Error then arises from <lb/>inadvertant mistatements in these <lb/>elucidative processes, and sin from <lb/>wilful and negligent ones; - real or <lb/>assumed facts being the <hi rend="ul">visible <lb/>figures</hi> (so to speak) by which they <lb/>are conducted.</p>

<p>In the foregoing disquisition, <lb/>the creative and providential intelligence <lb/>of the Deity is assumed as <lb/>indisputable, upon the fact of <lb/>that design in the structure and <lb/>constitution of the universe and its 
<lb/>inhabitants, by which Truth exists <lb/>physically and becomes morally <lb/>manifests, as an emanation or <pb facs="C386/0105.jpg"/> creature; - and but for <lb/>which, there were neither Truth <lb/>nor error; nothing in short but <lb/>accident, according to the <lb/>conclusion of the <unclear></unclear> who <lb/>hath said in his heart <hi rend="ul">There is <lb/>no God.</hi></p>

<head>Morning.</head>

<p>Morning has always proved <lb/>a vigorous and refreshing subject <lb/>in the hands of our greater Poets. <ref target="C386-0105">*</ref> <lb/>Milton especially delighted to <lb/>describe it - and his touches of <lb/>that kind, though of an epical <lb/>brevity <hi rend="ul">alive</hi> with the <del>very</del> <add>whole</add> spirit <lb/>of the season.

Every <lb/>word is moist with the dewy freshness <lb/>of the orient, and glows with a positional <lb/>splendor that may well seem to have been <lb/>flushed into it by the veritable <del>presence</del> <add>presence of the</add> <lb/><del>of</del> Aurora herself.</p>

<head><del>Tennyson.</del> Browning.</head>

<p><del>Tennyson</del> <add>Browning</add> is a very considerable <lb/>poet. There is no denying that. <lb/>But he would make his own <lb/>poetical idiosyncrasies the standards <lb/>of all poetical excellence, and he may <lb/>be said therefore to be self spoilt. <lb/>He would found a school, no less; <lb/>and <add n="1">to this end,</add> by way of <add n="2">fist</add> fishing for a "fit <lb/>audiance" <del>to this end</del>, he has taken <lb/>Obscurity into his poetical system, <lb/>not merely as a "welcome quest", <lb/>like Coleridge, but as a tenth <lb/>Muse. <add>- to the <unclear></unclear> of the orthodox <hi rend="ul">Nine</hi></add> And lo, he has his reward. <lb/>Every literary <del>Euphuist</del> <add>Mystic</add> who would <lb/>be credited with a capacity for seeing <lb/>further than other men, - not indeed <lb/>through a milestone, - but through <lb/>a poetical myth, has become his <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> critical worshipper; - the worshipper, <lb/>not of the light that is verily in <pb facs="C386/0124.jpg"/> him, but of the darkness.</p>

<p>Hence one of these wholesale <lb/>admirers of his genius, when poring after <lb/>the meaning of some of his poems (of <lb/>them the most cherished) may be well <lb/>likened to a cockney staring into a deep <lb/><del>and not over-clear pond and</del> <add>but</add> turbid <lb/>pond in the hope of seeing a <add>shining</add> fish at the <lb/>bottom. At last he sees, or thinks he <lb/>sees, something that may be a fish: <lb/>far down there amongst the weeds, or <lb/>between those stones half embedded <lb/>in the mud. "It must be a fish", says <lb/>he to himself; "what else <hi rend="ul">can</hi> it be? <lb/>A fish it certainly is - and if so, it must <lb/>just as certainly be one of the rarest <lb/>beauty! What eyes I have!"</p>

<p>But admirers of this sort are <lb/>never true lovers of true poetry. They <lb/>are intellectually devoted to nothing <lb/>but the seeming of a nice mental <lb/>singularity - an exclusive<del>ly</del> ideal <lb/>refinement. Hence any author who <pb facs="C386/0125.jpg"/> happens to be plentifully be- <lb/>-shadowed with obscurities is <lb/>sure to attach them in shoals; becauce <lb/>these very obscurities are the vantage <lb/>grounds of their pretentions to a <lb/>deeper critical insight than their <lb/>literary neighbours.</p>

<p>The vast sublimity of Milton's <lb/>whole description of Death at the Gates <lb/>of hell results entirely from the terrible <lb/>vagueness of the images: <ref target="C386-0132">*</ref> <add>as the reader will perceive</add> And afterwards <lb/>where he <del><unclear></unclear></del> would incidentally <lb/>characterise the same dread Being at <lb/>a stroke, by such epithetical figures <lb/>(if I may express myself) as the <lb/>"<hi rend="ul">grisly</hi> Terror" and the "<hi rend="ul">grim</hi> Feature", the <lb/>mightiness of the effect is made to loom <lb/>upon us <del><unclear></unclear></del> through the same mystic element <lb/>- a certain ideal vagueness.</p>

<p>In a like vein, and depending for <lb/>its sublimity upon the same element of <lb/>mysterious <unclear>vagueness</unclear>, is the following <del>d</del> account <lb/>of a vision in the Book of Job</p>

<q><p>"In thoughts from the visions of the Night, <lb/>when deep sleep falleth on men, Fear came <lb/>upon me, and trembling, which made all my <lb/>bones to shake. Then a Spirit passed before <pb facs="C386/0133.jpg"/> my face; the hair of my flesh stood <lb/>up: <hi rend="ul">it stood still, but I could not <lb/>discern the form thereof: an image <lb/>was before mine eyes, there was silence, <lb/>and I heard a voice</hi>, saying &amp;c</p></q>

<p>But it is not only in sublime <lb/>poetry that this ideal vagueness <lb/>constitutes an element of beauty. Milton' <lb/>Licydas is an example almost throughout <lb/>of how exquisitely it may be employed <lb/>in subjects purely pathetic. <del>His <unclear></unclear>- <lb/>- <unclear></unclear></del> The impersonation <del>of the</del> <lb/>in the poem of the rivers Cam (for <lb/>instance) contains an example in point.</p>

<div type="poem">

<q><lg><l>Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,</l>
<l>His mantle hairy, and his bonet sedge</l>
<l><hi rend="ul">Inwrought with figures dim</hi>.</l>
</lg></q>
</div>

<div type="prose">

<p>Now in this instance the Poet no doubt <lb/>refers, in fact, to the filimental tracery <lb/>which on close inspection <del>is</del> <add>were</add> observable in <lb/>the <unclear></unclear> of the sedge <unclear></unclear> the bonnet <lb/>of the river God; but the subtle <del><unclear></unclear></del> <add>manner</add> <lb/><del>wherewith</del> <add>in which</add> he so alludes to this unobvious <lb/><del><unclear></unclear></del> charactery, as to work <pb facs="C386/0134.jpg"/> out of it a further poetical effect <lb/>- an ideal apprehension of <del>mystic</del> a <lb/>certain vague and mystic beauty, is very <lb/>noticeable, and <del n="1">very</del> <add>no less</add> remarkably <del n="2">in <lb/>point</del> efficient.</p>

<p><add>Vagueness as a</add> <del n="1">The</del> poetical quality <del n="2"><unclear></unclear> <lb/><unclear></unclear> of</del> is akin no doubt to <lb/><hi rend="ul">remoteness</hi>; but it is <del>only so far</del> <lb/>identical with it only so far <lb/>as <hi rend="ul">ideal</hi> distance has its analogy <add>or substantive <unclear></unclear></add> <lb/>in <hi rend="ul">real</hi> - both <add>alike</add> tending to "lend <lb/>enchantment to the view." The <lb/>following sweet passage from <lb/>Coleridge (with which I <del><unclear></unclear></del> <lb/>conclude this little paper) will <lb/>in some degree explicate this position.</p>

<p>It owes everything but its music, <del>to</del> <lb/>and that partly, to the visionary <lb/>mystery of its subject: - the mere <lb/>remoteness of the localities alluded <lb/>to, - the <del>birth</del> maiden's country and <lb/>the mountain of which she <lb/>sings, - being utterly merged in the <pb facs="C386/0135.jpg"/> vague isolation of her ideal <lb/>advent.</p>
