                <head>Additions to Chaucer</head>
                <lg>
                    <l>As I speak of Chaucer in the Text, as being a well<lb/> of English undefiled
                        (the expressions being borrowed, I think from Dryden) I<lb/> would (just
                        observe here, on that head, that<lb/> our old Saxon words, though harsh,
                        are<lb/> mostly, <del>I think</del><add>to my thinking</add>, singularly
                        expressive. Now the<lb/> word <hi rend="ul">think</hi>, for instance,
                        appears to me to possess<lb/> in its mere sound a spontaneous
                        consonance<lb/> with the branial sensation <add>-- the intense throb</add>
                        which accompanies<lb/> the act of <add>abstractional</add>thinking) How
                            <del>expressive in this</del><add>similarly
                            expressive</add><del>way</del><del><add>similar manner</add></del> also,
                        are the words <unclear/>, crush,<lb/> creak, whirl, skin, slide, spill,
                        flight,<lb/> flop, growl, groan, pant, patter, thrill,<lb/> throng, and
                            <del>a host</del><add>multitude</add> of others?</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Even<lb/> Pope, though in the main so unfaithful <add>CH</add> to<lb/> his native
                    perception, was quite alive to<lb/> its verbal
                        <del>agreement</del><add>properties</add> here remarked on as<lb/> is
                    particularly evinced <add> in his translation of the Iliad</add> by the whole
                    description<lb/> of the Greeks felling timber<unclear/><lb/><unclear/></p>
                <p>(from classical prejudice)</p>
                <p>Additional to the <hi rend="ul">Criticism</hi> on Critical Reviews<lb/> The
                    <unclear/> above on the muse of Sir Water Scot, I <lb/> doubt not, will startle
                    many: yet I believe it is <add>a</add> just one. <unclear/><lb/> a good deal of
                    the fire and strength of poetical genius, he<lb/> had scarcely any thing of its
                    subtlety and grace. He could<lb/> outline the <add>poetical</add> face of things
                    correctly enough, but the<lb/> "living soul"> of it escaped him. And when
                    his<lb/> poems are apparently brightest, they are <unclear/><lb/> creatures of a
                    shallow stream, from <unclear/> very</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Preface.</head>
                    <p>In the expressed opinions of all men of indubitable<lb/> refinement, and of
                        comprehensive intellect, Poetry has ever<lb/> been accounted a high and
                        sacred thing. Imapassioning<lb/> the master spirits of all ages, those of a
                        merely mechanical<lb/> order excepted, it has been crowned by their united
                        au-<lb/>thority with the application og the Divine Art. Nor has<lb/> this
                        empyreal distinction been unworthily accorded to an<lb/> Attainment which is
                        the result of an indwelling love of<lb/> Beauty and Truth in their essence,
                        and which constitutes<lb/> in Man an affinity with the Seraph. Whatever is
                        con-<lb/>-stituent in a disposition to natural piety, and all that is<lb/>
                        elemental in human aptitude for a state of complete intel-<lb/>-lectual
                        liberty, are equally as essential to the full growth<lb/> and maturity of
                        poetic genius, and of the critical capacity<lb/> by which its finer
                        creations can be duly appreciated and <lb/> enjoyed. Mere worldlings indeed,
                        may be prone to<lb/> despise the mental riches of the Muse, and
                        common-place<lb/> philosophers to confine, theoretically, the influences
                        dis-<lb/>-posing to poetic feeling within the narrow boundaries of<lb/>
                        their own spiritual vision; but the more gifted children<lb/> of Taste know
                        on the contrary, that <hi rend="ul">those</hi> are amongst<lb/> the most
                        valuable legacies of the Past, and that <hi rend="ul">these</hi> have being
                        in all that is sublime and beautiful in the<lb/> Universe, to replenish
                            <add>it</add> as a whole with a subtler and<lb/> more exquisite unity of
                        Love. And thus boundlessly<lb/> prevalent, these influences are but
                        ingathered as to a centre<lb/> by the sovereign imagination of the Poet; not
                        so much<lb/><pb n="4" facs="C382/0009.jpg"/>for self-enjoyment, as again to
                        be given forth in<lb/> immortal verse, condensed and melodised, and
                        genial<lb/> with the fertility of passion; -- and it is only upon their<lb/>
                        having passed through this process, that they are perfected<lb/> in the
                        power of causing the hard heart of the listening<lb/> world to gush over
                        with unwonted bounty -- even as<lb/> the living waters were elicited from
                        the rock by the stroke<lb/> of Moses's rod.</p>
                    <p>Still I am painfully aware that amongst the<lb/> most virtuous portions of
                        educated society, there exists<lb/> at present a strong pre-possession in
                        disfavor of poetry.<lb/> I do not, however, infer from this, that there is
                        any vital<lb/> decay of imaginative taste amongst these the highest<lb/>
                        order of readers. On the contrary, I believe, that in such<lb/> circles, the
                        ideal requirements of our nature, poetical<lb/> as well as musical and
                        pictorial, are in constant<lb/> pace with the progress of <hi rend="ul"
                            >real</hi> refinement; and that<lb/> the disrelish above mentioned, is
                        owing chiefly, if not<lb/> solely, to <add>the</add> evil uses to which
                        compositions in this kind.<lb/> have been prostituted by certain modern
                        Writers of great<lb/> but depraved genius. But deeply as the Poetic Muse
                        may<lb/> have been thus sinned against, it yet behoves the refined<lb/> and
                        philosophic rightly to distinguish between her proper <lb/> tendencies, and
                        the moral alloy with which these have always<lb/> been more or less darkened
                        by the corruptions of her<lb/> children. Her true vocation is at once to
                        quicken,<lb/> exalt and purify, our nobler and more exquisite passions;<lb/>
                        and by informing the imagination with wisdom=sug=<lb/>-gesting beauty, both
                        to enlarge and recompense our<lb/> capacities of pathetic feeling and
                        intellectual en=<lb/>-joyment: and further, in social and national
                        regards,<lb/> to illustrate whatever is virtuous in design, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="5" facs="C382/0010.jpg"/> -glorify all that is noble in action;
                        taking occasion<lb/>-also, from time to time, to pour the lightning of
                        her<lb/> -holy indignation upon every thing that is mean and<lb/> -cowardly
                        in the people, or tyrannical and corrupt in<lb/> their rulers.</p>
                    <p>In another and more fanciful view of the<lb/> nature and office of Poesie,
                        her creations may be said to<lb/> stand in such relation to human life as
                        dreams do to<lb/> the state of slumber. When the tone of this state is
                        healthy,<lb/> these are cheerful, full of promise, beautifully
                        fantastic.<lb/> When diseased, on the contrary, they are boding, full
                        of<lb/> horror, monstrously incongruous. So is it with the creations<lb/> of
                        the Muse, according as the individual minds in which<lb/> these are
                        produced, and the social soil on which they are<lb/> intended to operate,
                        are morally healthy or otherwise. --<lb/> And to continue the analogy in the
                        better part of its<lb/> agreement, her winged things of Love are also,
                        in<lb/> their forward flight, -- like dreams, or what we may<lb/> suppose of
                        dreams, -- sometimes prophetic. Like<lb/> these too, in a salubrious sphere,
                        they beautify the<lb/> common, and transmute the terrible into the
                        lovely.<lb/> They convert the frowns of misfortune, and the litter<lb/>
                        glances of enmity, into smiles of benevolence, and tears<lb/> of
                        reconciliation. They annihilate distance as with<lb/> the "wings of the
                        Morning", and captivity as with the <lb/> the starry liberties of the
                        Universe. In fine, they recall<lb/> the past, enchant the present, and
                        realise the future; --<lb/> restore the lost, renew the changed, enrich the
                        poor, and <lb/> reunite the living and the dead. And without them, --
                        that<lb/> is, a Polite Literature, -- society is a mere machine for<lb/> the
                        production and consumption of food, comfortably<lb/> oiled at the joints and
                        wrapped in lamb's wool.</p>
                    <pb n="6" facs="C382/0011.jpg"/>
                    <p>With regard to the outcry which has ever<lb/> obtained more or less amongst
                        certain religious<lb/> bodies against all profane fiction, and especially
                        if<lb/> of a passionate cast, it should be observed, that the<lb/>
                        <hi rend="ul">morality</hi> of Poetry, like that of all other
                        influences<lb/> affecting human conduct, is precisely correspondent to<lb/>

                                    <add>and</add> I<lb/> notice this particularly, because at the
                                time of writing it,<lb/> I was poorer in my outward circusmtances
                                than at<lb/> any other period of my life: -- out of employment, out
                                of<lb/> friends, out at elbows, out of hope. So desperate, both<lb/>
                                immediately and prospectively, was my worldly condition,<lb/> that I
                                began to revolve the subject of suicide in my mind,<lb/> to consider

                                was lest the fact should<lb/> tell against poetry and ports: lest
                                the low thoughted sneerer<lb/> should have it to say: Such is the
                                moral fruit of the Tree of<lb/> poetical knowledge. And I was the
                                more sensitive on this<lb/> head, from feeling, that so far from
                                being weakened in mind<lb/> by my poetical studies and exercises, I
                                had thence derived<lb/> that very reflectional strength which was
                                even then lighting<lb/> me on to a great moral victory over the
                                shame and pain of<lb/> poverty: -- From feeling, in short, that I
                                had always been most<lb/> faithful to every duty when most studious
                                of the Beautiful,<lb/> which is also the Good; and least observant
                                of any when most<lb/> neglectful of the Muse. -- I <del>speak in the

                                than then; <add>For may years I was</add> being obliged to associate
                                daily</del> with persons whose natures could value nothing in
                            mine<lb/> that I valued myself; whose souls indeed had no faith for<lb/>
                            anything in <del><unclear/></del> God's glorious Universe that was not,
                            in<lb/> their own vile phrase, "mone worth." Thus circumstances, when I
                            reflected what "miserable men" almost all our Poets<lb/> had ever been
                            through the unfitness of similar compulsory<lb/> associations, I had
                            nearly armed myself in the resolutions<lb/> of destroying as far as I
                            could, all poetical record of my<lb/> being: and of living mentally
                            apart <del><unclear/></del> for the<lb/> remainder of my life, dying
                            eventually, like the wolf, in<lb/> silence. But as time slid on, I
                            gradually thought and felt<lb/> myself out of this bitterness of <hi
                                rend="ul">love</hi> -- for such it was; love of the<lb/> Beautiful,
                            crushed into bitterness by the burthen of its own<lb/> incommunicable
                            wealth. This analysis of feeling may be<lb/> sneered at by the prosaic,
                            but a "fit audiance though few" will<lb/> understand it better, by
                            virtue of a lovelier
                                experience.<add><del><unclear/></del></add><add>C.H.</add></p>

                            of a thousand currents of joy, bright and gushing as the<lb/> mountain

                        <p>To <del><unclear/></del> prevent my admiration of Shelley's poetical<lb/>
                            genius and character, from being misinterpreted into a kindred<lb/>
                            atheism, and yet, at the same time, to vindicate the right he<lb/> had,
                            not only to worship at whatever shrine he chose, but also<lb/> to
                            advocate whatever he believed true; I will append to this<lb/> Monody
                            some remarks on what I consider a proper Liberty<lb/> of Speculative
                            Opinion.</p>
                        <p>To begin: -- I believe in the existence of a God, the creator<lb/> and
                            providential disposer of all things. Nothing, I appre=<lb/>=hend, could
                            shake me from this belief, but am I therefore to<lb/> denounce the
                            atheist, who in all social respects may be a far<lb/> better man than
                            myself; seeing that many so believing ac=<lb/>=cording to <add>the</add>
                            general notion, have been singular for the moral<lb/> beauty and purity
                            of their lives? By such a course, what<lb/> do I do more than instigate
                            him in turn to denounce his<lb/> denouncer till between us, Charity, --
                            that which should<lb/>be "all mankind's concern", -- is hunted from our
                            homes?<lb/> If it be a damnable sin to disavow any established or<lb/>
                            peculiar Idea of the Deity, upon the disavower's own<lb/> head be it at
                            the tribunal of Heaven -- not here. But<lb/> what if his
                                <del><unclear/></del> disavowal carry with it points of<lb/>
                            disbelief as to the God-Ideas of every other man or set<lb/> of men in
                            the world? He should be left perfectly free<lb/> notwithstanding, either
                            to believe or disbelieve, since he<lb/> is fallible only in common with
                            all other men; and openly<lb/> to state and reason upon his convictions
                            either way, so<lb/> long as this be done in decent terms and without
                            personal<lb/> intrusion. Out of blending contrariety harmony
                                <del><unclear/></del> arises; and our moral differences should but
                            constitute<lb/> the moral music of life. <add>For Truth, though one in
                                its essence, is manifold<lb/> in its attributes; and
                                <unclear/></add></p>
                        <p>I will endeavour to illustrate the opinions just<lb/> stated by an
                            Apologue. But I would previously observe,<lb/> because of the shocking
                            import of the word Atheist, that<lb/> perhaps no highly intellectual man
                            is, or ever was, what<lb/> is commonly understood by this term. Shelly,
                                for<lb/><pb n="30" facs="C382/0035.jpg"/> instance, was not. He was
                            eminently spiritual is his<lb/> speculations; and in fact, his Energy of
                            Love, or Good,<lb/> has many of the attributes with which our best
                            con=<lb/>-ceptions of the Deity endeavour to illustrate his
                            benef=<lb/>-icent Supremacy. -- On the other hand, the vulgar<lb/>
                            irreligionist is never an atheist. He neither believes<lb/> nor
                            disblieves: his intellectual state, with regard to<lb/> spiritual
                            things, being simply that of a brute indifference.<lb/> So much by the
                            way, and now to the Apologue.</p>
                        <p>There were two Islands in the midst of wide sea, <lb/> several leagues
                            apart, one of which was inhabited <add>and the other</add>
                            appear=<lb/>-ently not; the uninhabited one being, at the same
                            time,<lb/> from the abrupt nature of its coast, wholly inaccessible<lb/>
                            to the dwellers upon the other. Yet these might perceive in<lb/> clear
                            weather, from their own Island, which they called<lb/> Earth, that a
                            mighty Tree grew upon the summit of<lb/> the other, which they had named
                            Heaven. Now with re=<lb/>-gard to this Tree, of the several Earthites
                            who had en=<lb/>-deavoured to approach it as nearly as possible, in
                            a<lb/> large canoe built for the purpose, some declared that<lb/> its
                            leaves were broad, its blossoms blue, and its fruit<lb/> oblong; which
                            others of the expedition denied, by affirm=<lb/>-ing, that the leaves
                            were long and narrow, its blossoms<lb/> white as snow, and the fruit
                            perfectly round. Upon<lb/> this great disputed arose amongst the
                            inhabitants of<lb/> Earth, and they parted into Sects. A beautiful and
                            winged<lb/> virgin who had a<del>l</del>lighted upon their Island they
                            knew<lb/> not whence, and who went by the name of Philosophy,<lb/> would
                            have reconciled these differences by referring them<lb/> to contrarities
                            of perception amongst the voyages, or to<lb/> some occult property of
                            the object in dispute, or in the<lb/> atmosphere surrounding it; -- but
                            in vain: one sect con=<lb/>-tinuing to defame another by the appellation
                            of Non=<lb/>-truists; because, said the disputants on all sides, to<lb/>

                            balance of<lb/> metres, plentifully besprinkled with exclamatory
                            prettiness is,<lb/> which they consider proper to poetry, if not poetry

                            good poe-<lb/>-try is just good <del><unclear/></del> prose, as far as

                            more. These<lb/> virtual qualities of poetry are often injured by the

                            and secretive. Her love was<lb/> long her burthen, and I watched the
                            manner of it, as<lb/> occasion offered, with an interest bordering on
                            solicitude --<lb/> and had eventually the pleasure of seeing her the
                            bride of<lb/> the Beloved. -- My brain akes, and my heart sickens,<lb/>

                        imagination over<lb/> the Outward; the other, a concentration of all
                        external<lb/> things, past and present, upon the Inward: and
                            that<del>the</del> this address to the Echo is peculiarly of the latter
                        species,<lb/> as the Poem immediately preceding it is of the former. --<lb/>
                        If I might illustrate this difference by references to the<lb/> poetry of
                        others, I would say, that Shelley's classes mostly<lb/> with the first kind,
                        and that Byron's comes chiefly under<lb/> the head of the last; while that
                        of Milton and Keats is<lb/> mainly a blending of both. The ideal complexion
                        of<lb/> the one species is green and golden, of the other (or latter)<lb/>
                        an intense but cloudy azure; while their blended effect<lb/> has its
                        semblance, or outward type, in that of the green<lb/> hills and blue waters
                        of the earth, when canopied with<lb/> the <del><unclear/></del> morning or

                        national perditions of Europe. How long<lb/> will our shopkeepers and yeomen

                        that it matters little how, or by<lb/> whom, these vast tracts are held, so
                        long as plenty of beef and<lb/> wool is grown upon them; is if social

                        splendid is never a<lb/> happy land. Immense inequalities in the
                            propr<add>i</add>etorships of its<lb/> soil are the arch curses of
                        England, giving birth but to two national<lb/> monsters, a-- a heartless
                        magnificence in the rich, and a social hope=<lb/>lessness in the poor, which
                        become in turn the parents of an au=<lb/>-dacious denial in the

                        wretch it starves" <add>in the very heart of abundance.</add> Again I say, a
                        splendid is never a happy<lb/> land, because wherever there are palaces
                        there are hovels: and this<lb/> should determine us in Australia to have as
                        few of either as possi-<lb/>-ble. Nay more. Wherever <hi rend="ul">even</hi>

                            man, the individual, is often desperate=<lb/>=ly wicked. Communities

                            Still the surviving sense of man-<lb/>-kind, as to right and wrong, and
                            glory and shame, is unfail-<lb/>-ingly just in the end. In the darkest

                            the contempt and enmity of<lb/> nine out of every ten delinquents who
                            should make the<lb/> same observation under the same circumstances. Even

                        <p>I will append by way of Note to this criticism an ex-<lb/>-quisite bit of
                            prose from the pen of an American Poet,<lb/> (Lowell.) "There is in him
                            the exuberant freshness and<lb/> greenness of Spring. Everything he
                            touches leaps into<lb/> full blossom. His gladness and humour and
                            pathos<lb/> are inepressible as a fountain. Dam them with a<lb/> prosaic
                            subject, and they will overleap it in a sparkling<lb/> cascade that
                            times even <del><unclear/></del> the hindrance to a beauty-<lb/> Choke
                            them with a tedious theological disquisition,<lb/> and they bubble up
                            forthwith all around it with a<lb/> delightful gurgle.xxx Reading him is
                            like <del><unclear/></del><lb/> brushing through the dewy glades at
                            sunrise; every<lb/> thing is new and sparkling and fragrant." --
                            There<lb/> is a bright bubbling bead of beauty upon every word<lb/> of
                            this passage. For freshness of thought and felicity<lb/> of expression

                    <note xml:id="C382-0060">
                        <p>For more than a year of my youth, Shakspeare was<lb/> nearly my whole
                            reading -- was, in fact (and luckily) almost<lb/> the only book my means
                            could at that time command. At first<lb/> I perused him rapidly right
                            through, in order to take in<lb/> at one mighty draught his entire
                            spirit. Then I repe-<lb/>-rused him with minute attention, -- that is,
                            critically; un-<lb/>-derlining every beauty I could perceive, even to a
                            felicity<lb/> of phrase. I next reconsidered the whole, transcribing
                            as<lb/> I proceeded, almost all that I had previously
                                underlined.<lb/><pb n="56" facs="C382/0061.jpg"/> After this, I
                            again read him attentively through, with an<lb/> eye to the punctuation
                            alone; and yet again <add>for</add> the sole<lb/> purpose of testing the
                            progressive steps in his versification.<lb/> From this last reading, if
                            I recollect aright, I came to<lb/> the conclusion<del>s</del>, that all
                            his British historical Plays, with<lb/> the exceptions of Henry VIII.,
                            Cymbeline, and Macbeth, were<lb/> amonsgt his earliest productions; and
                            that his Roman<lb/> Plays, Hamlet and Othello, with all his Comedies,
                            except the<lb/> Comedy of Errors, the Two Gentlemen of Verona, Romeo and
                            Iuliet,<lb/> and another or two, ranged subsequently, -- with the
                            Tempest<lb/> last; in which his blank <add>verse</add> is quite as
                            interflowing as Milton's,<lb/> though, of course, somewhat looser and
                            less measured.</p>
                        <p>Of the style of these Critical Rhymes, I will remark <add>and of all of
                                my poems of a like kind</add><lb/> here, once for all, that though I
                            have avoided in them the pre-<lb/>-cise couplet balance of Pope, as a
                            mere mellefl<del><unclear/></del><add>uous</add> monotony,<lb/> I have
                            yet considered that something of such a balance should<lb/> be
                            maintained, upon the whole, in our regular heroic rhyme;<lb/> believing
                            moreover, that a certain blank-verse-rhymed style,<lb/> (if I may
                                <del><unclear/></del> coin <del>the expression</del><add>a term for
                                it</add>) now much in vogue, is just<lb/> such a failure as might be
                            expected to follow from the meeting<lb/> of extremes, however strikingly
                            it may indicate (as it does)<lb/> the prior existence of an opposite
                                abuse.<add>C.H.</add></p>

                        <l>Even such a bard was Waller: yet, 'tis true,</l>
                        <l>Some credit was his <hi rend="ul">literary</hi> due:</l>
                        <l>With rugged models, studious to refine</l>
                        <l>The pause and cadence of the <del><unclear/></del> Heroic Line,</l>
                        <l>He gave <del>its rhymes a periodic <unclear/></del><add>that periodic
                                pace to rhyme</add></l>
                        <l><del>To the then popular poetry unknown</del><add>While Pope <hi

                    </lg>
                    <p>This is hardly giving him all his due. He wrote many<lb/>bright things. Some
                        of his Lyrics are exquisitevely finished and<lb/> truly beautiful. Still I
                        believe the above estimate of his genius<lb/> and character is correct in
                        the main -- <del>as</del><add>is</add> far as it goes. His<lb/> fashionable
                        tact alone, would be conclusive to my mind of<lb/><pb n="61"
                            facs="C382/0066.jpg"/> his secondary order as a poet. No great poet is
                        ever the possessor<lb/> of this characteristic; for if he were, it would be
                        fatal to his<lb/> greatness, because it would inevitably lead him to
                        affect<lb/> the modial, to the neglect of the primary, both in
                            <del>Man</del><add>Nature</add> and<lb/>
                        <del>Nature</del><add>Art</add>. It is eminent in Rogers and Moore, and
                        indicates<lb/> their order as conclusively as it did Waller's: while it
                        commands<lb/> in their regards the same compensations. Like him, they<lb/>
                        will enjoy a prime rank with the Present, and a secondary<lb/> one with the
                        Future: while Wordsworth and Leigh Hunt, like<lb/> Milton in the prior
                        parallel, will have to wait in the grave.<lb/> for <hi rend="ul">their</hi>

                        also to Waller's having improved upon the heroic<lb/> rhymes of some of the
                        poets then popular (see Donne<del>'s</del> &amp;c.),<lb/> it should be
                        remarked, that in avoiding their faults, he slided<lb/> into an opposite

                        <del>much so, that</del><add>Hence</add> in reading him, we would often

                        <p>It has sometimes struck me since this criticism was written,<lb/> that,
                            from my being at that time too much under certain modern<lb/> literary
                            influences, I hardly did "glorious Iohn" justice. Still<lb/> I think
                                <del>that</del> he was deficient in that fine breadth of eye and
                                <add>that</add> open<lb/> relish of heart for the simplicities of
                            Nature, which are the surest<lb/> indications, as the fruits of them are
                            the most lasting manifestations,<lb/> of a thorough poetical genius. He

                            modernizing Chaucer, who is streaked all over with evidences of

                            <del>fresh frank</del> morning gladness, he conventionalised his
                            pictures<lb/> into mere stage scene-paintings. And wanting <add>in</add>
                            these, he was<lb/> wanting in the most <del>perpetuative
